# Week 11

## Wild erranding
Collectively performing missives for the wild, the unruly, the antipolitics of dissent - in the abiding effort to live toward an ungovernable future-present

A creative reach for other bodies and other body politics for life that never stops angling toward the embrace of ever-widening horizons

The wilderness is everywhere around us, not separate, not other
growth and undergrowth of our institutions

a surround, a geography that has been built over but that is no less here and underway

both a physical space and an affective horizon

Decentering the human, the anthropomorphic
opposite of anthropomorphising

How to enact this recontextualisation, focus on the *doing*

### I Was a Teenage Exocolonist
In the future, Earth is uninhabitable due to global warming (capitalism)

Player plays as a teenager born in space on a spaceship, ship crashlands

Power and force, power is always relational, Foucault

### Phenomenology
Branch of philosophy that centers body and bodily experiences
interested in how individuals come to know the world in and through the bodies
emphasizes the significance 

When first introduced, really interested in just body
Now body in relation to mental processes

Through these experiences, we form our identities and relationships

### Candy exercise
Talking about how it feels, how it tastes, etc.
Using phenomenology

### Orientation
The concept of facing something or someone (not a metaphor)

Humans form relationships to world through orienting phenomena, repeated orientation
Can be applied to imagined phenomena in contemp. philosophy
(ideas, norms, concepts)

Ex. classroom
All the students are oriented towards teacher, all together, side by side
teacher is oriented towards students

### Bindeogames
videogames impress themselves on player through sensorial experiences

Having played a game, repeated orientation towards a game, we all share

## Affect theory

### Key terms
#### Affect
Immediate response produced by an encounter before the response can be consciously organized

#### Sensation
Refers to an organism's physiological response to an encounter

#### Emotion
Refers to the socio-linguistic interpretation of sensation and/or affect

### Bear example
Encounter with the bear, noticing each other: affect
Being sweaty, flush, heartbeat: sensation
Those sensations being fear: emotion

### Politics of emotion
What if I had ran into a man alone in the forest?
A group of young men alone in an alley
Training, distinction between teddy bears and real bears'
Trained to have different responses to different aspects
Political reasons here

### Games
We have affective relationships to the games we play

Videogame play has physical consequences
The controller makes you interface with the game sensorially, even if it's in a limited way
(Three Fourths Home!)

Pacman has a very direct anxious response

It's a skill to use a controller!
A physical skill that you have to learn and access

Random encounters in an rpg or horror games can imbue environment with a diffuse affect

## Queerness in games, queering and failure

Queerness, embracing strange, in identity or desiring

When we explore queerness in games, it does not necessarily mean that it directly represents gay people, that the devs are gay, that it was built intentionally in it, or that every player experiences this queerness or in the same way

these readings don't erase a "straight" one

### Failure
In a system that values a certain kind of success, choosing to value failure can be a kind of resistance

In late-stage capitalism, abundance is valued
To succeed is to have and hoard as much resources as possible

But, resources are finite, if some people have far more, others have less
If we choose to fail, refuse to accumulate we unsettle the underlying notion, ideology of capitalism, challenges the system itself

Not reorienting to a different value system, but using failure as a lever to challenge the current one

In games,
Requires actively engaging with the game
Simply leavin git al

### Failing...

#### With
Failure that is shaped by the system
(not really failure)

Ex. Stanley Parable:
The game presents defying the narrator as failure, but ultimately it wants you to do that
Roguelike games
Celeste?

#### Against
Failure that resists the operations or narratives, failure that is discouraged by the game


### Examples
Being chased by ghosts in Ms. Pacman
More radical potential in the sense that you're avoiding the 

Burnout
Might not be failing against,
but a reminder that failing can be fun!
Catharsis?
Releasing emotion!
