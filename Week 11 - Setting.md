Killing Moon excerpt
Materiality of the colours, (oily swirls of amethyst and aquamarine, it's all described in very physical language)

## Sound of Thunder
Contrast of sparse vs dense description
Moment of the T-Rex appearing, v sparse single lines, silence, "sh", before the T-Rex comes in
Then, boom! Huge block of description
