# Week 4 - Genesis & Eve

Compared to other mesopotamian creation myths, God is not a warrior
It is God's acts of speech that bring about the creation of the world
The word used for the 10 *commandments* in Hebrew(?) is more related to speaking thatn commanding
Begins with the word "beginning"

Reminder: our questions are what does the text bring to us and what do we bring to the text?

Explains how the world came to be, why it came to be
Why do we not live in paradise? in Eden?
Because Adam and Eve eat from the Tree of Knowledge
Why was eating from the tree bad?
(sex metaphor? A later association, Both are ultimately v pro-procreation)

Focus on work,
having to work for food, for clothes,
for life

## 1 & 2
Genesis 1 & 2 have different creation myths for Man
In the rabbinic tradition, they interpret it as a general thing first and details after
1 is sociological, 2 is existential

### 1: Equality
God said "Let us" (Genesis 1:26)
"God created him, male and female, God created them"
Did he create man first then woman?
Or an androgynous being, then split?
Or the unity of both, two versions?
Is the image of God in both genders? In every human?
Some discourse earlier on, eventually decided that this is the case
However, rabbis did not want to say that women could/had to conquer,
So they break with the equality here

### 2: Companionship, humanity
"It is not good for human to be alone"
This is not about human beings noticing something sucks
It is God *telling* human what is good or bad
That man cannot survive aloneness
Then, what does he need?
A "helper"?
Two Hebrew words
Often read to benefit patriarchy, as a submissive role
A more accurate translation though is more "like you"
"Bone of my bone, Flesh of my flesh"
Difference from the animal world

## 3
Called The Fall in Christian circles, not in Judaism
No concept of the word *sin*

At the start, neither one has a name
The word for human is "adam"
Then, he takes on Adam, and she becomes Eve

Sex?
Some traditions say it's so overpowering that one can make a mistake
Some say it's fun

Disobedience & consequence
leaving Paradise
Work for food, work for birth
suffering? Similar word, some traditions bring them together

Exchange between God and human (1st!)
God asks what's happening
They heard His voice in the garden,
felt shame, hid
Who told them to feel shame?

### Punishments
God then turns to all three actors and gives punishments

**Snake**
- cursed (only one)
	- not permanent for human
- made to crawl
- no voice

Woman
- pain in childbirth
- relationship w/ man
	- urge for, desire for husband
	- he shall rule over her

Is this descriptive or prescriptive?
Rabbis decide to interpret it as descriptive instead
Nobody says no to tractors, to tools for men's work
Thus, this part must also be descriptive

Later on, with Serah(?) and Abraham, God tells Abraham to listen to her and do as she says
Somewhat contrary to other parts of the bible
Other sections where submissiveness to men performing immoral acts are bad
