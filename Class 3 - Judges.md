# Class 3 - Judges

## Peeps
Ruth, Naomi, 

## Intro
From both political and feminist perspectives, time of transformation

The book is about multiple political figures
Meant to convince the people that they need a king
The people cry to God, ask him for a saviour, he sends some, but these are temporary
The "judges" in the title could perhaps be better translated today as "chieftains"
The people in the book also don't exclusively worship God, also worship some other deities
Doesn't end well for them
The book begins with people in a generally good place, including for women
Ends in horror, tribe of Benjamin, house of Levi
By the end, the people wanted authority, hierarchy (so the book claims)

## Typology of anonymity
Chapter 11: Jephtha's daughter
Why is she unnamed?
What does anonymity do for the characters
Adele Reinhardt's Why Ask My Name?

They are not unknown, we know some things
But, we don't know their self, their identity?
Reduces to actions, relations

### What does a name tell us?
Can speak to social status, lineage
If one uses family name instead of first name, it emphasizes these external relationships
Can bring individuality 
Can take away privacy, can identify

### Anonymity in the bible
Men and women are both anonymous in the bible
Sometimes the people are made anonymous who are indeed considered bad, distasteful, do the wrong thing, etc.
example of a man in the story of Ruth

This is not always the case, though
Not quite so clear in the story of Jephtha and his daughter

Also, God remains unnamed (not going there rn tho)

### Jephtha
The relationship between Jephtha and his daughter is emphasized
Ultimately, Jephtha *fails* as a father

Jephtha was a soldier
Son of a whore*
*who is she?
interpretation to be done
Was she an occasional partner? a concubine?
Regardless, not the right **lineage**
Leaves (kicked out?)

When under threat from the Amorites
Return to him and ask for his help
Jephtha agrees under the condition that he is allowed to lead afterwards
This contrasts his roles as a leader, patriarchal figure, father

Reaches out to Ammon, tries to make peace, doesn't work
Thus, he turns to God, in exchange for victory, offers to sacrifice first thing that comes out of his house to greet him upon his return
Jephtha not entirely sure he will win, self-doubt, thus reaches out to God
Expects it to be an animal, as they lived in the ground floor of the home
But,

Forgets a custom in Israel
⭐️ Women coming out of house dancing to celebrate a returning soldier
So, when he returns, he is greeted by his daughter
His only child

Comparison to Isaac, Abraham's only daughter

He tears his clothes, a custom of mourning, still the case for Jews
At first *blames his daughter*, then states his vow is non-rescindable
In the Talmud, (unclear to me how real it is?) she tries to argue for him to renegotiate, he refuses to go to the high priest as he is the leader
In the Tanakh, she accepts his vow as it is
The story, the story only proceeds because she accepts
This *justifies* his vow, his actions

She then *negotiates*, and asks for two months with her *women* friends
⭐️ Important break with patriarchy here, both the negotiation, as well as the acknowledgement of close relationships among women
She could have offered to marry and have children instead, have a life

Specifically, she asks to go to the hills to cry over her virginity*
*This translation is off, definitely doesn't that she never had sex, accordign to modern ideas
A lot of discussion over what the original Hebrew word means
(I saw marriage)
Recent anthropological and feminist work posits this could mean adolescence
One specific anthropologist believes the ancient world had a ritual of adolescence for women

He agrees, she returns, she is sacrificed, and she "had not known man"
The narration states that thenceforth there was a ritual for the women of Israel
4 days a year to celebrate Jephtha's daughter
No record of this ritual

#### What does this all mean?
She is not quite unnamed
Affirms some level of agency, of individuality in her negotiation, and her acceptance
What she asks for, time with her female friends, calls attention to her interiority, her identity and individuality
This also in a way, removes her from her relationship as a daughter

She is the *daughter*
And Jephtha is her *father*
both relationships equally insisted on
Also emphasized is her being his *only* child
thus his *lineage*, his legacy ends
She calls attention to him *opening his mouth* in her acceptance
Him opening his mouth *without thinking*
He isn't thinking of his family, of women, of his daughter, despite him meant to know this custom of women greeting warriors
