# Week 3


## Ludology v. narratology
What kind of object is a videogame?
What tool should be used to study them?
What is the impact of studying them like this?

## Semiotics
dev. out of linguistics to study language

### systems
meaning is created in relation to the system as a whole
study of langauge is the study of a system

### Signs
Composed of two parts:

**Signifier**
sound or word image

**signified**
concept

Ex., the word tree and the concept of a tree itself

signifier only holds meaning because of convention
They are learned, cognitive, not visceral
language systems not just textual

**Denotation**
Literal or common sense meaning of a sign

**Connotation**
socio-cultural and personal association of the signs

## Symbolic World
World created by a cultural phenomenon
ex. Gotham, Verona

One way to study symbolic worlds is to examine different meaning-making or semiotic systems

### Ex. Pac-Man grid
shape and colours, not real, denote ghosts, circle with triangle denotes face or mouth

## Narratology
at first, finding words and ideas to analyze the systems of narratives

### Narrative
An account of a series of events, facts, etc. given in order, 

Composed of two things
**story** and **discourse**
What and how

Character: subject who may or may not be animate
Setting: spaces, places, temporal situations
Mimesis: Representation, imitation
Diegesis: the storyworld

event: change of state in storyworld, can be materially observable, can be thoughts, feelings, experiences, can be intentional or unintentional
plot: sequencing of events for the audience, can be different for diff. people in games
episode: set of coherent situations or events
agent: anyone within diegesis that has capacity to change the storyworld
non-diegetic: element of discourse that audience has access to but characters don't

understand and clearly define trems
apply the term to a case study to identify elements
indicate how the term helps us better understand the operations of the narrative
make an argument about why a better understanding of the story matters
