# New Normal Brainstorming

I feel like it's been too long since I did something ghost related lol

**New normal**
I feel like I want to explore digital degradation
How things get lost, change
The ethereal quality of digital things gives the impression of permanence, but the reality is far from that

Reusing old video? home video?

**Concert video idea**
Editing together a bunch of my old concert footage
Ironic that I feel such a strong need to record it in the moment and I almost never return to it
Ultimately, this video pales in comparison to the actual experience
An attempt to represent how it feels through the imperfection of the recording?
Those 3DS recordings of conert where the sound is all blown out
