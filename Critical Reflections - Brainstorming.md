# Critical Reflections - Brainstorming

## Biofoams

### Possible avenues of exploration
- Ephemerality, material that doesn't last long (but sustainably so)
	- designing an object's end of life
	- constraints of an object that doesn't last
	- possible thematic explorations
		- ex. Banksy 
			- in making graffiti, and what one does with the graffiti afterwards, part of the piece
			- is the wildly expensive selling of his work afterwards a capitalist reclamation of the intended message?
			- does he actually not care as much about this political statement?
			- does it matter whether or not is it intended if it gives him money and / or fame?
	- decentering humans in design
- Sensorial aspects of design
	- smell
	- touch
	- colour
- Other possible external sources
	- crank powered devices
	- paper sensors

### What did I think about it?
I like the capacity for ephemerality here, the way, like a lot of other things we saw, it allows for the creation of objects, both useful and artistic, that emphasize their ephemerality in a way that has a purpose (as opposed to like, concert videos being made artificially scarce)

I like that in so doing, it respects the environment, engages with the reality that all things must end, as opposed to making things out of everlasting materials that don't even maintain utility in that lifespan

And yet, as mentioned, it was relatively trivial to then make more foam

So many things are made to be disposable out of materials that do not dispose, that stick around for ever (**look up numbers**) (maybe theories regarding **disposability**)

Almost makes me think about death, our culture's relationship to it, the constant need to avoid it (**could cite Caitlin Doughty????**), probably best suited for a conclusion

Made me wonder about the usefulness of archives, for how long should we maintain media? Does everything not die eventually? 

From the research on interfaces made with similarly (even more so) ephemeral materials, it indeed seems to back up the point the paper has in the discussion section about how this can lead to designs that base themselves off of the material instead of trying to bend the material to our will

also keep thinking about Three Fourths Home, the deep resonance created by how that game makes you confront endings

The knowledge of impermanence brings value, situates something in time, in context
The resurgence of the aesthetics of obsolete media speaks to this
imperfection, wear, also leads to familiarity, personal connection
The vinyl records I own have certain recognizable issues that make them *mine*, especially if I caused them

### Research
People felt connected to their specific melted ice, curious about how other people had used it

Can induce tension in a game setting, trying not to destroy the interface 
Rules of the game changed to introduce more of this play about whether or not to do something more risky

Article about wear shows how people can become more connected to their worn objects, how the knowledge of ephemerality makes them more theirs

### Plan
Main thing: I am fascinated by the idea here of v impermanent materials for design, ephemerality

Paragraphs?
- Main idea presented: Due to its sustainability, the paper advocates for the use of biofoam in design by presenting its many characteristics and variations 
	- It's easy to source, create, reuse
	- It's easy to modify and tune to one's needs, as well as inspiring new possibilities
	- unique sensory qualities, able to hold various aromatic compounds 
	- main "limitation" of ephemerality is more of an asset

- ephemerality is what I was most drawn to
	- Something being ephemeral brings to attention its context, situates it in time
	- being ephemeral can make something more precious, as its wear and tear is unique to that object, to that *context*
		- Long history of this with kintsugi
		- Example of the ice interfaces
		- Rise of interest in obsolete media
			- Haunted Demo Disc, Signalis, resurgence of vinyl, 
	- Three Fourths Home: ephemerality is uniquely suited to deal with certain themes
		- Calls attention to how long the player spends playing the game with unique drive button
		- player can select the music to play in the car, play with the wipers, turn lights on and off, all in a little animation at top, allowing them to tune their own specific experience
		- Plays with a narrative feeling of dread, knowledge of the storm, allegorical story told within the game

## Plant radio

### What did I think?
I found it really fascinating how where we wanted to make artificial rules, they found ways of decentering humans more directly. Also found it interesting how we ended up focusing on collaboration, ambiance, systems, where they focused a bit more on simply giving a plant agency

The omission of a power button is really fascinating, especially with regards to prioritizing the design intent over power consumption. Was it the right artistic choice? I think yes, but I do wonder if the power consumption doesn't dampen this somewhat.
Also makes me reflect on how little our devices turn off these days for our comfort. Windows' half sleep, phones being awake enough to tell us they're dead and turn themselves back on immediately upon being reconnected.

Makes me think of games also that exercise a kind of agency over the player, such as that bdsm game that Bea mentioned, **Kitty Horrorshow**'s 000000FF0000 and Anatomy,
I wonder if I could apply posthumanism to readings of those games?
Also makes me think about my thing about unpleasant art, art that makes one confront discomfort
This decentering process could be uncomfortable for some? (**could look for research here**)

Lots of other examples of decentering in games app.
Ex. Mountain, design research game Bug-Tug
Already finding myself personifying the mountain, wondering why it hasn't talked to me, being v charmed when its fall started
Really interesting how something's independance is made so felt through such simple design decisions, such as in Mountain.

So many possibilities for incorporating posthumanism, decentering human
Environmental reasons (seeing other beings as worthy of respect), connection (Mountain through its independence), even when confronting negative emotions (Kitty Horrorshow)

Interesting though how these manifestations are to a certain extent for humans, as they are meant to impart meaning on humans (brought up in paper). 

Oh! Abjection! that's how the decentering is uncomfortable!

### Plan
Main thing: the way the researchers decentered the human experience by taking agency away from the human, the "user" is what I find most fascinating

Recap of paper:
- researchers set out to integrate posthumanism in design
- created a device that sonifies plant electrical data
	- gives a voice to plant
		- changes over course of day depending on what happens
	- chose to make the sounds hard to simply ignore, not ambient
	- pushes people to "tune into" plant
	- can not be turned off!
		- agency taken away from person

Loss of agency is what I was most drawn to
- An incredible way to provoke this kind of reflection in people, as it invokes the abject
- explain what abject is
-  ex: 000000FF0000
	- game is designed in such a way that it enforces its agency over the player
		- file sysytem
		- kicking you out
		- unpleasant imagery, glitches, scale
	- what is an object's agency?
- not everything has to be horrific tho,
	- mountain
		- still takes agency away from you
			- the game mostly happens without you
			- you get to watch!
		- still uncomfortable
			- can be kind of boring at first, thinking of it as a game
		- mountains are their own beings, includes all the trees and birds, etc.
- can also lead to more systemic thinking
	- Fiction Facade
		- a bit more of an active role
		- but also along with the building!
		- everyone is contributing to this experience,
		- on equal footing
