# Week 3 - Avant-garde, modernism, RUpture Generation

## Intro - terremoto del '85

Presidente en el momento no hablo hasta 3 dias despues
orders of magnitude more destruction than hiroshima(?)

terremoto del 2017
hundreds of dead, 40 buildings destroyed

Marking events in Mexican history, continue to be commemorated to this day

## Last class - muralism

government promotion of didactic propagandistic public art
An attempt to homogenize Mexican peoples and culture
la raza cosmica, mestizaje

propulsed Mexico into the global art stage

plastic integration
attempting to achieve collaboration between artists, architects, engineers

## Readings
treinta-treintistas & estridentistas
Two art movements contemporary with muralism, even past it

Some of these were critical of the nationalist movement

## Open air painting schools
search for new ways of creating & teaching art to new people
another avenue for attempts to expand nationalist identity
democratisizing art, new educational project
Targeted poor indigenous children
sought to empower them, teach them their history
Bringing indigenous values into modernity
indigenous people seen as embodying Mexican national soul

Most artists going into revolutionary period were educated in Europe
Open air painting schools inspired by Barbizon school of painters (Millet, Rousseau, etc.)

Paintings to come out of the movement:
- nature, landscapes
- peaceful
- outside of big historical narratives
- everyday life, people
- practicing, not merely seeing national identity

### Alfredo Ramos Martinez
educator, painter, muralist
lived in Mexico, as well as United States, Paris
became leader of San Carlos Academy in the middle of the revolution

Concerned with bringing art education to the people
~50% illiteracy rate

wanted to teach outside of classrooms
Exterior as inspiration
questioning who is deemed an artist


### Best Maugurd dawing method
change not just in subjects and painters,
but also in teaching methods
Studied in Europe
Taught at open air schools

spiral, circle, arcs, wavy lines, lines, etc.
Could be used by anyone to make paintings

### Abraham Angel Card Valdes (child painter)
Inspired by fauvism
bright colours
representing everyday life

## Treinta-treintistas (30-30)
revolutionary anti-academic painters
name comes from rifle used in revolution
existed from '28 to '30
mounted experimental exhibitions
(public spaces, open to everyone, in barrios)
plasatered manifestos, published journal
Sought audience of everyday people

focused on woodcuts
- highly flexible, open aesthetic
- affordable
- hand made, but
- reproducible
- could disseminate political ideas
- could be used for avant-garde and/or folk art
- outside of institutions

Campesino, obrero, revolucionario
proletariado!
marxist nationalist ideology
but, contrary to muralism,
everyday life
context erased

believed in art as a revolutionary force
artists = art workers

## Estridentistas
multidisciplinary movement
focus on modernity, urban life, technology
contemporaneously, printmaking, woodcuts, etc. were also used for counter-narratives

Founded by Manuel Maples Arce
posted a manifesto (Actual No 1) on walls around Mexico City
Believed because of technological advancements (communications and travel) it would be possible to communicate across the world
implored artists and scholars to inspire themselves from the urban environment and the "experience of modernity"
A personal exprience, not imposed
Against "standardisation of imagination"
(critique of the muralist project)

Gabriel Fernandez Ledesma
Fernando Bolanos Cacho
German Cueto
**Tina Modotti**,
Nahui Olin
(elena ponatovska, wrote noveliada de Tina Modotti)

Demographic shift towards urban centers
Social classes divided in the city, 
rich people in the west and poorer people in the east
idealistic, utopian vision of technological development,
lack of representation of working classes and poor people

muralists advocated for bringing past into the future
whereas stridentists sought to let go of the past

### Social art vs Pure art
What is modernity?
Mexican identity?
how to move forward from revolution

estridentistas believed in "freeing" art form political discourse
Return to easel painting
questioning large narratives
More personal experiences
