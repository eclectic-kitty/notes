# Week 10 - Globalization

## Intro

### On purpose... (1997)
120 Stolen car radios from black market
projected video of artists stealing a car radio
Mexico City: An Exhibition about the Exchange Rates of Bodies and Values at the PS1 MOMA

Perhaps something about confronting rich people with a reality they don't have to think about often
Discomfort of confronting poverty and crime

Feels potentially a bit contextless to me though, would someone just come away scared of crime?

Art is not an object, conceptual instead!
contact with public

found objects, land art, body art, installations, readymades, etc.

### neo-conceptualism
integration of new mediums
digital electronics, communication technology, etc.
search for new forms of collaboration
locally and globally

under capitalism, art is a product
acceptance, market success = end of conceptual art
art as commodity

Jeff Koons
sold for record amounts!
Shiny giant balloon animals and stuff
Often critiqued as kitsch, commercialisation, etc.

Félix González-Torres
Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)
175 pounds of candy (ideal body weight of Ross)
diminishing weight -> loss of body weight due to AIDS
continually replenished, eternal life

### Globalization
ongoing reconfiguration of time and space
redefines relationships between these
interconnections, economic transactions, capital movement
social and cultural movement
mobility in general

### Neoliberalism in Latin America
"Democratic transitions", end of dictatorships in Chile, Argentina, Mexico
political elites, influence of global capital, US
NAFTA agreement
Economic disparity worsens
Larger private sector, decreasing public sector

### Alternate exhibition spaces!
End of '80s, start of '90s, hard to commercialize neoconceptual art
big institutions timid (did change later)
ex: La Quiñonera (1987 - today)
House of couple who decided to retire outside of the city
children turned it into art space!
ex: La Panaderia Gallery (1994 - 2002)
An actual bakery in the past!
Transformed by a few artists, including Okón who lived above

Vicente Razo, *Salinas Museum*
Gallery of popular figurines in his bathroom ridiculing Salinas, president at the time
in Razo's bathroom!
Why look for museums to accept him when he can just found his own museum!
"stop doing readymades / start making museums"

### Art criticism
Curare
V important magazine of latin american art
Cuauhtémoc Medina
Curador de MUAC

Polyester
Kurt Hollander, New York curator, lived in Mexico

### New museums
Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC)
de la UNAM!

Kurimanzutto Gallery
private gallery, v important

Architecture!

Jumex Collection
son of Jumex owner

Soumaya Museum
also called the toilet
inspired by architecture of some other museums like the Selfridges in Birmingham

### The global turn
decentering, reorienting, remapping, reorienting the unified field on art History
exposing what was previously unseen
art museums expand their collections, engaging more with a world-wide art scene, non-western art
A belief in the erasure of identification, no more passports, transcending nationalities

latin american art
aesthetic in a western world
Does this victory not reproduce a form of cultural domination?

Orozco and Hirst, similar work in conecptualism
similar works with skulls!
Both live a bit everywhere but have ateliers in Mexico
(labour is cheaper there...)

Damián Ortega
Cosmic Thing (2002)
blown up (as in a diagram) VW Beetle!

REcommendation letters!
Printable barcodes for discounts in grocery stores in CDMX, Ottawa, San Francisco
Artists are political actors!!!
engaging the public, interesting connection to muralism
context: end of '90s, '00s
beginning of .. ?

## Raúl Aguilar Canela

fascination with narco culture
images of drug violence, body bags, etc.
Un blog del Narco
Traditional media had an unspoken agreement to not show drug violence

wanting to give honour to people in these images
smooth, floating, renderigns of these people's heads

Movingn out of school, away from violence a bit
exploring three poles: history, aesthetics, power

What are different ways of making a painting?
carving plaster, pouring plaster with another color into grooves
plasticine painting
canvas in cement
incorporating laser-cutting

anime was exported to Mexico and broadcast on national TV
Japan produced cartoons very cheaply and was successful in exporting them to the global south
What does it do to have the melodrama be such a big part of childhood?
Screenshots of hospital scenes (flowers in hospital rooms) painted (or printed?) onto t-shirts and hung in galleries

Difference between printing and painting, spending time with it
the flowers were indeed paintings of screenshots
