# Week 2 - Archive - Tutorial

## Art I saw over the break
I saw a horror movie called Men, directed by Alex Garland and starring Jessie Buckley

I have mixed feelings about it but in ways that I find very interesting and get at questions I have about what I want in art.

To begin with, I very much enjoyed the *experience* of watching it. It had gorgeous colours, masterful cinematography, evocative imagery, a haunting a-capella score, an engaging and tense story, and an absolutely ridiculous finale that entered fully into a more dream-like state.

However, my qualms about it have to do with the themes and messages explored. A lot of people, I think fairly, don't like it because it very much feels like all it has to say is men can be bad, and then goese to show ways in which this is the case. It's very un-groundbreaking feminist stuff
