# Untitled (5)

## Starting point - the damsel in distress
Slasher films were aimed at teenage / young adult men
Sometimes you are placed in the pov of the killer (ex. british film, Peeping Tom)
Often not heard too much, often no reason to 
Poe: the death of a beautiful woman is the "most poetical topic in the world"
De Palma: Women in peril work better in the suspense genre
Hitchcock, quoting Sardeu: torture the women! The trouble today is that we don't want torture women enough
the victim-ier, the better
should be beautiful, helpless, *attacked*

Women can't identify with anything in these movies? Right? ...

## Final Girl
often chaste, barely survives
But, 
Ultimately, different to the damsel in distress
Is active, instead of passive
She's intelligent, watchful, level-headed
the first to sense something is wrong
Often atypically violent
Often saves herself, but at the bare minimum survives long enough to be safe

Clover argues that final girls often have androgynous qualities
Ex. Laurie, Sydney
Often don't wear much makeup, overly feminine clothes
Often don't have boyfriends, or are not all that into them
Not traditionally feminine

Who has control over women's body?
Black Christmas, character wanting an abortion
Is it the boyfriend? the killer? the police?

The final girl is white
Noted by some how slashers are one of few genres where people are broadly asked to identify with women,
but, counter example,
captivity narrative
women taken by indigenous people
Old books, probably made up, about women returning to colonial society about time spent in "captivity"

*Didn't quite get the point in this video about race and the final girl structure (other than the fact that most are white)*
*Is it the lack of investigation of her inner world?*

It is perhaps this adrogynous nature that allows men to identify with her
Challenges typical notions of how audiences identify with characters
Masculine authority figures are summarily dismissed
Not masculinity being privileged, but masculinity + a female body

It's not meant to make these women more appealing sexually
ex. not like, I can hang with the boys, I'm not a girly girl, etc.`

## Nightmare

What is failure?
If the audeince decides that's not what they came for, is that good or bad?

Chaskin
"There was certainly some intentional subtext but it was intended to play homophobic rather than homoerotic..." - Chaskin
Admits he didn't admit it earlier on to not be obvious, supposedly

Englund, Patton, even a makeup artist recognised this queerness

Previous film was a gay film,
Could he play straight?
Got cast in this film, abandoned by director and writer

Testing only available in 83
Not terribly helpful for most
not very useful treatments, those are expensive

His partner finds out he has aids

He ended up leaving Hollywood

### AIDS
Nightmare 2 was released in one of the worst periods of the AIDS pandemic
81, first cases seen in white gay men
young *white* men weren't supposed to be manifesting the symptoms they had
gay-related immune disorder
recently classified as a mental illness too
even if lesbians weren't presenting, the cis world didn't care

### Disidentification
recycling and rethinking encoded meaning
the process scrambles and reconstructs the encoded message of a text
