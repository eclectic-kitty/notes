# Week 3 - 

## Relationships b/ designers and clients

Clinical
- designers diagnose
- then prescribe 

Service
- users know best
- designers responsible to provide *right* service

### Participatory Design (PD)

#### History
- Action research in '70s in Scandinavia
- Workers concerned introduction of IT would dislocate, de-skill, disempower, worsen conditions, limit their influence
- (Software) design researchers argued computers were tool for management to control workers
- Question of power

#### PD worldview

- Democratic endeavour that gives stakeholders a voice in building and exploring their present and future practice
- Assumption of equality between designers and users
- Negotiation
- Interpretivist view of reality over positivist view
	- Positivism: reality is stable, experienced the same way, universal truth (western science worldview)
	- Interpretivism: no stable reality, it is interpreted by people, interpreted in different ways by different people, interpretations coexist
- Users are the experts of their own lived experience

#### Making, telling, enacting

Scandinavian software designers wanted to involve workers in design process
Workers did not have language necessary to express their design needs
Designers took it upon themselves to help them get involved

Making of things, telling of stories, enacting of possible futures

##### Telling
Making it easier for users to give u information

Technique: Design games
- Games flatten power distance
- PD Games for:
	- exchanging perspectives
	- war stories
- Rules
	- Counteracts uncertainty about power relations, place in power relations

Technique: Photovoice
- Giving a camera to people, enabling them to capture and share elements of their environment & experience
- Giving voice, critical consciousness & social change as goals
- Documentable evidence for conveying this experience to others

Technique: Future workshops
1. critique
	- Criticise the current practice
2. vision
	- Create visions that address the concerns
	- often as an imagined future
3. implementation
	- Work out actions, obstacles, and resources required to realize the vision

##### Making

Technique: Cultural probes
- Boxes of weird tasks, etc. more artistic
- subjectivity
- Not looking for the logical picture of someone
	- dreaming, weird, inspirational
- Slightly alien
- Provoking out-of-the-ordinaary responses, ambiguity, absurdity, mystery
- Inspiration, texture, creative contexts

Technique: Co-design prototyping
Involve users in simpler, smaller-scale aspects of design
Ex. dyslexia platform
- Talked to experts
- Experts showed up with current activities, boring, unengaging
- Came up with game mechanics to try and bring to life activities
- Aesthetics? Is there a connective game narrative?
- Asked students' input on context, aesthetic side to mechanic

##### Enacting
We're 3D, our whole bodies are involved in cognition

Technique: Bodystorming
- Rich bodily and situated engagement with ideation
- Designers using their bodies to enact design functionality or usage
- Ideating with physical objects in real world
- Ex. interface where people have to complete circuits together with their bodies
	- Prototyping size of board, how close to get to others
	- Strangers? 

Technique: Theatre of the techno-oppressed
Looking at how tech 
- Theatre of the oppressed
	- Brazilian dramaturgist wanted to use theatre for emancipation
	- Had people act out situations of oppression
	- Multiple iterations with different people (audience)
	- Getting input from audience on different ways to approach problem	

## Making sense of Data

### From data to patterns

#### Categorisation
Others' mental models don't always match 

#### Card sorting
- Insight into peoples' mental models of a domain
	- how they understand
	- think about it
	- categorise it
- Concerns *ontology*
	- how things relate to one another
- need participants and cards labelled with concepts
- Open card sort
	- participant provided categories
- Closed card sort
	- categories already provided

#### Affinity diagramming
- A bunch of random data u need to organise
- Creating order around unstructured data
- Put each idea on a post it
- start grouping post its based on affinities
	- create and identify categories
- works well with a team

#### Empathy mapping
Want to understand people who use platforms, get a sense of their lives
- Interpreting and humanising user research
	- format for empathizing with users
- You might have to infer some elements, such as "feels" and "thinks"
- useful at start of process - still getting a sense of problem space
	- after user research
	- before requirements and concepting
- Potential precursor to personas and journey mapping
- one empathy map per person type
- categories can be adapted / added

4 quadrants what is the person
- saying?
- thinking?
- feeling
- doing

#### Personas
Abstracting a type of person, using as shorthand essentially

- User reseaarch feeds into category types,
- Used to determine how different types of users might, in particular contexts,
	- experience
	- react
	- behave
	- contexts:
		- goal-based
		- Role-based
		- engaging
		- fictional

#### User story
- Originates from Agile Software Development
- software feature described from perspective of usesr
- What are they doing and why?
- Often take the form, "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]"
- from dev perspective, user stories drive what features get developed
- verification: is functionality present? has the user intent been met? helpful during all forms of testing

#### Journey / Experience map
What user actions will be performed for a given intent?
What thoughts? emotions?
Go through journey at different actions
How many steps and blockages are in user's way?

SHould always include actions and experiences
