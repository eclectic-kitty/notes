# Week 2 - In Class - History, Kurzweil

At some point, when an idea occurs to me: write down a phrase to initiate the sketch of the idea

## Study Tips and Hacks with Rowena 

Everyone learns differently!
Difficulties can be an emotional regulation issue! Not an intrinsic difficulty
Sometime it is tho

### Organisational suggestions!
Add stuff to planner!
Keeping notes in what place!
Sync across devices!

### Managin readings
Reading visually isn't always the best!
Could convert PDFs to OCR (with PDF24 potentially)
Programs:
- Dragon
- Microsoft Edge PDF reader
- JAWS

### Managing writing
Text-to-speech software or vice-versa!
Dictate ideas! Edit ideas
Mind-mapping tools
**Practice!**

### Misc.
Active engagement!!!
Always better than actively listening
Take notes, use a highlighter, take breaks

Resources:
ldadhdnewtork.ca /assistive-technology
additudemag.com

### Citation managers
Save time!
No need to re-enter sources
WIll handle 

## A.I. 

Donald Hebb, neurology, cell assemblies
Changing 

Rosenblatt: Connectionism
information is connectivity
New information bit by bit, creating new connections
Steering a ship by little bits of feedback at a time

Lin margulas margules? virus that entered a cell and became key part of the mitochondria

## History

### Jacquard Loom
FUlly automatic
Runs by punch cards

### Analytical Engine
Based on loom
Conditional branching
controlled with punch cards

Lovelace first to realise people could make music, have cultural ideas, etc. 
Purpose could go beyond calculations

### Knowledge 
History of knowledge storage, from notch sticks, to ropes, to punch cards, to computers
Quipu, method of encoding information via knots in the Andes

Cecilia Vicuna
Brain Forest Quipu
Explores death, rage, environmental and cultural destruction
Tu rabia es tu oro

Study of ideas: turned into calculus
missed name

Grace Hopper:
coined term 'bug' after finding a moth in the circuits of an early computer

Norbert Wiener: Cybernetics
Combined neurology, model of neurons, threshhold knowledge unit, recursion learn from its environment and carry on

Claude Shannon:
combine binary and boolean knowledge to create computers
informational entropy, how much noise is in a signal? compensating for it
measuring possibilities of binary choices, bits?

### Information, entropy, communication
Information teory part 12: Claude Shannon's inrofrmation entropy video
Two machines outputting 1st 4 letters from alphabet
One is random, one is according to probabilities 50, 12.5, 12.5, 25
Which one produces more info?
Rephrasing question, how many questions do you need to guess next symbol
Random one takes on average 2 questions, other on average 1.75
Less information for probability based one
bit equivalent to a coin flip, fiar bounce of a ball of a peg board, measure of surprise
Entropy is highest when all outcomes are equally likely

in terms of signal processing, entropy measures how easy it is to predict what comes next

problems of a communication system
technical problems: accuracy
semantic problems: meaning
effectiveness: has meaning been interpreted correctly

human to human communication has been with us for ages, but how do we include computers in comm.

Measuring amount of info?
capacity?
noise?

information must not be confused with meaning
information = logarithm of the number of choices
Does the internet or the word yes contain more information?
Trick question, choice containse the information
how do we store, then access a bunch of information, what it is does not matter

language is statistical: leads to modern AI, simple statistical connections so numerous that it has/displays meaning

Markov Chains: 
stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event
what happens next depends only on the state of affairs now

## Readings

### Women, gender, etc.
Introduces topic of social construction
copyright respect, good art, etc.
Socially enforced, programmatic

Connects to last reading about surveillance capitalism

## Ray Kurzweil
One cannot predict the future, but
law of accelerated returns
progression of information technology is exponential

Sees AI, like other tech, as extending the reach of our brains
acknowledges it is a double-edged sword
Still feels a little too trusting that impact will be good?
Mentioned ending poverty, but couldn't we end poverty now if we wanted to? What if access is controlled or it works in such a way that it only helps rich people instead of poor people


# Writing exercise
Do computers interpret the information that passes through it?
Is the human experience the model for life?
capacity does not = experience, humans have memories, bodies, etc.
Human experience not homegeneous
How do you distinguish between real and created experiences
a machine made to fool a human =/ a machine made to be a human
What human element do we need


# Write down a phrase, question?
It seems we've solved how to store information with regards to computers, the technical problem, the information.
How do we get machines to care about the meaning, the semantic quality of the information? How do we ensure AI cares about the information it generates and deals with?
(am I using the technology)

Ray Kurzweil seems to think tech will make us smarter, extend the reach of our brains. Do they not have the capacity to not do that
