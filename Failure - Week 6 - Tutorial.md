I failed to recognize that my partener had drifted away from me
I was certain I could still feel her lips on mine, her arm around my shoulders, her cat on my legs. I hadn't realised I had fallen out of her bed and mistook her ghost for the whole of her.
Why did I fail to notice? Are my senses so dulled?

Apology dice
makerbros and David garneau
response to Canadian gov. apologising forf residential schools
rolling dice with words to make a sentence

words that can do nothing but fail
apology is a beginning, but can never be enough
not to make light, disarming vehicle for prompting discussion

writer + chief curator of The Kitchen
bodies travelling though the glitch fail joyfully
when machines break, we can't just sit there and do nothing
we have to act
perhaps we want the break
