# Final - Temp Brainstorming

## Q3 - Womem

The point *is* to compare

So Teresa Margolles / Lorena Wolffer is def the way to go, locking in!

theses:
- Margolles: Utilizes the gallery space in a way that she makes absences felt, palpable, but subtle
	- absence caused by death
		- deaths, ofc, of marginalized people
		- i.e. poor people, *women*
	- also absences caused by the erasure of marginalized realities
		- ex. night club floors
		- women, trans, sex workers
	- **absence** of the marginalized
		- absence is important because it is key to this subtlety
		- it's more than possible for someone to experience on eof her works and not realize what it means (utilizing conceptualism's flexibility and vagueness)
		- nevertheless, there is something wrong with her work, it feels like there's nothing there, or at least that there should be more
		- representing how so many people live in a state of willing ignorance
		- ie this absence is felt
		- hopefully, driving one to investigate, and then to learn the truth that they have been suffused with this absence, with death
	- possible theories to connect to
		- globalization
		- no-objetualismo
		- necropolitics
		- gore capitalism
		- abject
		- hauntology???
			- Doesn't quite directly apply in either the Derrida or the Fisher sense
			- Both have to do with other times haunting the present, erasure of barriers
			- yes, there is a similar erasure of barriers here,
			- but, it's less temporal, the audience is not the one who has lost a future
			- instead, it has to do with real ghosts, actual dead people, as well as an erasure of geographical and social barriers when considering the audience
			- that being said, there is a similar examination of the failures of neoliberalism and capitalism, much in the same way as Fisher, the failure to manifest of a peaceful future free of drug violence????

			- That being said, there'as a section on ethnography that seems promising on Wikipedia
- Wolffer: U
