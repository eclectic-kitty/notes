# Prompt 2 - Definitions
Aurora Becerra Granados 

“Home” can mean many things, and a studio or an office (whether it be inside your home or outside it) could be considered a home for your art practice or scholarly work. Last semester, artist Diyar Mayil divulged that she keeps her own personal dictionary of words and materials as part of her studio practice. For Prompt #2, you will pick three keywords from the Winter syllabus (for example, failure, nature, the body), and write a one-sentence definition of each of these terms in relation to your own practice. These three one-sentence “definitions” are your own creative definitions of each term and do not have to relate to how the term is defined in a standard dictionary. Make these keywords your own, make yourself at home in them. Pick the keywords that speak most to your interests / practices / materials.
