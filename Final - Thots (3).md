# Final - Thots

## Early, brainstorming

### Advice from Effy
What specifically about their relationship is going on? 
How did they meet?
How is their intimacy?
Their types of relationship?

Dunno what that first line meant exactly, probably like, wanting to know more about their dynamic and relationship? How they relate to this act
Also confused about "types of relationship" but I have an idea

Flashbacks as things start to get heated
Beginning before the intimate moment
Wouldn't mind more description
Maybe with more stuff before, interrupting the middle could feel more in place

Descriptions added to a scene are less predicated on the momentum than the overall structure 
Boat metaphor

### Thots going in
I like the story ending and starting where it does (esp that ending of being embraced but not feeling safe, not quite feeling that same affection), so I don't think I want to add scenes chronologically.

I am upset I didn't have more of the descriptions at the beginning, or a conversation at the end. The conversation especially feels like a good place to extend. Really dig into how they would react to this kind of situation.

For before, I wonder if a negotiation scene would be worth it? It would emphasize the betrayal, but would do away with the element of surprise. Then again, not sure if the surprise is as important a moment in a longer piece. Although I like how it potentially makes the audience initially see the protagonist as the one causing harm. I like the idea of writing a kink negotiation, have to try to make sure am not being too allegorical again about the biting as an act. The negotiation could also help establish the danger.

Wonder if I can switch perspectives? Could be a fun way of representing the connection between them, could also help communicate why Laura doesn't stop Vic.

Why *does* Laura not stop Vic? I don't like the idea of her planning to do this, but there is a definite death wish here. Need to make sure to write it as something that she doesn't even entirely know. I also want to maybe put other casually self-critical stuff in how she talks (vibe ex. something bad happens -> joking I'm going to kill myself) It's ultimately a mix between just sinking into the feeling and not quite having the energy, the need to live where she wanted to lift herself up. She might even be aware of what that means, but she can't bring herself to fight the feeling.

Possible new starting points? The middle of the negotiation? Going into Laura's room? Vic arriving at Laura's?
