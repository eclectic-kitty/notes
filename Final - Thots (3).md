# Final - Thots

## Early, brainstorming

### Advice from Effy
What specifically about their relationship is going on? 
How did they meet?
How is their intimacy?
Their types of relationship?

Dunno what that first line meant exactly, probably like, wanting to know more about their dynamic and relationship? How they relate to this act
Also confused about "types of relationship" but I have an idea

Flashbacks as things start to get heated
Beginning before the intimate moment
Wouldn't mind more description
Maybe with more stuff before, interrupting the middle could feel more in place

Descriptions added to a scene are less predicated on the momentum than the overall structure 
Boat metaphor

### Thots going in
I like the story ending and starting where it does (esp that ending of being embraced but not feeling safe, not quite feeling that same affection), so I don't think I want to add scenes chronologically.

I am upset I didn't have more of the descriptions at the beginning, or a conversation at the end. The conversation especially feels like a good place to extend. Really dig into how they would react to this kind of situation.

For before, I wonder if a negotiation scene would be worth it? It would emphasize the betrayal, but would do away with the element of surprise. Then again, not sure if the surprise is as important a moment in a longer piece. Although I like how it potentially makes the audience initially see the protagonist as the one causing harm. I like the idea of writing a kink negotiation, have to try to make sure am not being too allegorical again about the biting as an act. The negotiation could also help establish the danger.

Wonder if I can switch perspectives? Could be a fun way of representing the connection between them, could also help communicate why Laura doesn't stop Vic.

Why *does* Laura not stop Vic? I don't like the idea of her planning to do this, but there is a definite death wish here. Need to make sure to write it as something that she doesn't even entirely know. I also want to maybe put other casually self-critical stuff in how she talks (vibe ex. something bad happens -> joking I'm going to kill myself) It's ultimately a mix between just sinking into the feeling and not quite having the energy, the need to live where she wanted to lift herself up. She might even be aware of what that means, but she can't bring herself to fight the feeling.

Possible new starting points? The middle of the negotiation? Going into Laura's room? Vic arriving at Laura's?

I almost want to make that earlier micro-story how Laura and Vic met, but I think it's the previous person that Vic killed.

Oh, Laura absolutely has a kinky coquette Tumblr blog with the images of girls being kidnapped, cut, etc.

Wait it's so cute to think of Vic having to wear winter clothes not to keep herself warm, but to keep her skin looking nice

## Settings

### Laura's apartment
I think overall her apartment is small, she's rich, but still young. So just a room and a living room / kitchen and a bathroom. The building is relatively old, with floorboards that are drifting apart. The paint is many layers thick, bunching up around corners. There are painted over dents in the plaster too. The paint has been applied in multiple layers, in some areas you can see the paint underneath. The apartment is in a nice part of town, much nicer than what Vic can afford.

Her bedroom is very small. There's a bed just big enough for two in a corner with a small window opposite its wall. The walls are a light pink, close to white. The window is covered by a pink curtain that lets just a little bit of light through, keeping the room dark all day (helpful for Vic). There's a just barely enough room for a bedside table and a desk with a computer beside the window. It hasn't been opened in so long and Laura spends a lot of time in there, making it stuffy and smell like her. The bed is soft to the point that it can be hard to move on it. It's covered in soft pillows and plush toys.
The walls have a couple of shelves with figures and books on them, and where there are no shelves, there's posters and flags, crooked, a few with a corner peeling off.

The outside is decorated similarly, although with less density. The area between the kitchen and living room has tiles that rise up above the floorboards and a curved awning in between. There are dishes piling up in the sink, a pot with bits of rice on the stove, cute novelty measuring cups and ladles mixed in with thrifted cutlery.

### Bar where they met
Queer dive bar, occasionally frequented by the woman who sired Vic. People don't tend to care about those who go missing here. First floor of an old brick building with a neon sign outside, alleyway beside it. It features warm incandescent lighting, a somewhat detached bartender, chipped wooden tables and barely clean glasses. 

## Scenes

### Meeting at the bar
Laura ended up there after a night out with friends, convincing them to continue drinking there, although most of them left, leaving her alone, where her and Vic met. Vic approaches first, after noticing Laura looking

Did Vic intend to drain Laura that night?
Probably, but I think she changes her mind partway through, probably in part due to guilt from thinking of the Victim

### Negotiation
How soon would negotiation happen after Laura finding out?
I think I like the idea of it happening right after
How soon would Laura find out?
I like the idea of Vic *trying* to hide it, but utterly failing...
Like, why are u working night shifts as a security guard girl?

This can be like the earlier scene I wrote, but with less anger. Vic is hesitant, afraid to hurt her, but Laura insists she wants to try it, she wants Vic to feel comfortable, she finds it exciting, etc.

Okay, I like the idea of this happening in Saint-Henri Park for some reason...

#### Fall or Winter?
- Winter
	- cold, frozen, **death**
		- oh yeah, Laura wants to die, it's this one, folks
	- they're all bundled up
	- if it's snowing / misty, everything is bright, light doesn't come from anywhere in particular
	- maybe Vic could lock onto Laura's heat better?
	- dramatically smells her even through the coats, the cold, etc.
	- they can get closer to each other, etc.
	- everything is quiet because it's snowing

### Argument
