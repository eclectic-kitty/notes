# Fiction Workshop Feedback

## Daniela Guillen Chacon - What Could Have Been

1) What were your first impressions as a reader?
I felt very pulled into the story. I was having an easy time relating to the protagonist and had pretty much forgotten what the title was, so the turn (twist?) hit rather well. I was also initially struck by the characterization of the guy, I loved the little moment of him excitedly leading but turning back often.

2) What is the story about?
The story fits into the romance genre of fiction. It's about getting wrapped up in a crush,  opportunity, destiny, bravery, and the need to be honest with others.

3) What aspect of storytelling does the piece emphasize?
The story seems to emphasize the relationship between its protagonist and principal supporting character, as well as character arcs. To this end, the text focuses on describing the interactions between them, as well as inner thoughts

4) What aspects of the piece are working well?
The piece does a good job of drawing you into the protagonist's perspective through descriptions of her thoughts and feelings. That being said, I felt like pacing and making the story feel cohesive could be a little better. The individual scenes worked well, but there were a few sudden shifts, such as the moment when the protagonist decides to ask out her friend. Here, it felt like there was an inciting element missing leading to the decision, as well as an end to the scene. The decision to leave at the end also came a little out of nowhere.

5) Develop one or two questions to ask your peers.
Why did you choose to not give the main characters names?
What do the two characters like to do together?


## Agathe - A Family Secret

1) What were your first impressions as a reader?
What stood out to me right away was the world building. Perhaps it's because this is intended to be chapter 2, but there were a lot of details mentioned that weren't immediately explained, which I found very compelling

2) What is the story about?
The story's genre seems to fit under coming of age supernatural romance. The latter categorization is tenuous, but the introduction of a character near the end of the piece seems to hint at it.

3) What aspect of storytelling does the piece emphasize?
The story emphasizes the protagonist's perspective as well as its fantastical setting and associated world building. The writing is in first person, and the reader is left just as in the dark about the setting as the protagonist, leaving the reader firmly planted in her perspective.

4) What aspects of the piece are working well?
As mentioned above, the unexplained references to the world work really well to create mystery. That being said, there are too many moments where the exposition is given to the reader somewhat flatly and in too much simplistic detail, robbing it of tension and mystery. Another successful element is the aforementioned perspective, especially a scene where she asks questions about the world to characters who all understand and is ignored.

5) Develop one or two questions to ask your peers.
What audience are you envisioning for the story?
What is the central conflict you envision for the overall story?
