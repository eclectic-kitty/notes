# Final - Proposal

Keyword combination: "framing the body"

We often take for granted that our bodies are under our control. But for almost all of us, our bodies simply don't behave the way they're "supposed" to. Despite our best efforts, they smell, they secrete, they age. They're not even entirely ours. However, the fiction that we can tame our bodies is reinforced incessantly. We are shamed into buying endless products to try and tame our bodies and behave the way we are expected to. I chose the keyword combination "framing the body" because I want to explore artworks that present radical reframings of what bodies can be to shock and entrance the audience into reworking their own internal framings of bodies.

Pieces:
- Annihilation, film, Alex Garland
	- Annihilation presents a space where bodies are melded together, creating simultaneously monstrous and beautiful new forms. Barriers between bodies are broken in a story about the inevitability of change and the thin barriers between selves.
- Anatomy, videogame, Kitty Horrorshow
	- Anatomy presents a house that has turned sour after years of abandonment. It grows sinew and teeth and tries to repel the player. They are forced to confront the bodies of the non-organic things they take for granted and trust unquestioningly 
- Human Botany, film, Four Chambers
	- Human Botany is a pornographic film that juxtaposes macro footage of flowers with macro footage of bodies having sex. Sensual acts and body parts become scientific objects of curiosity, both deeply private and completely depersonalized.
