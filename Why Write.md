# Why Write
#### Aurora Becerra Granados

I remember so many lunchtimes spent in the staircase in my high school. I dreaded every single time I would hear the door open while simultaneously trying to will messages from friends to appear on my cracked screen. While the extremes of those years have softened somewhat, it's still moments like these I think that most push me to be creative. Moments when my mind and soul are heavy and dragging with feeling. I want so desperately to name it. I want to let the mist seep from my fingertips and solidify. Allow it to expand and fill the empty staircase. Stop flinching at the sound of the push bar. Allow others in to watch me conjure the feeling, hold it, turn it over in their hands and understand this little piece of my self, and maybe theirs too. *A True Magic Trick*. Light that vibrates through the nothing of space. Not a particle and not a wave. I went to the staircases because they were the emptiest places in the school (near my classes). I hope I can give others the power I wish I could give that girl bleeding alone on the steps. The power Julien and Kevin and ----- gave me. The power to rename their blood and bruises and grey matter. It's a power I lack so often these days, unable to find the names without overflowing again. Somehow that girl managed to stain a piece of cardboard on top of the kitchen cabinet with our blood and I wonder if they can tell me. _[How to] lick our wounds and put us into past tense._

Last line is from the song Nobody's by Touché Amoré that I've been listening to a lot.
