# Ex. 1 - User Research

## Brief
Imagine that you are on a team that has been tasked with developing a new approach to (or platform for) social media, in the wake of many people choosing to no longer use Twitter/X. The age range of the intended audience is 18-35. Core assumptions driving this approach include the following:

- people can simultaneously subscribe to very different identities - including but not limited to the range between personal to professional
- people don't necessarily want all of their identities (or the communities associated with them) to "mingle"
- people prefer not to constantly have to check multiple different platforms/accounts

You are the user researcher. You have been tasked with developing insights into:

- how and why people from the target audience use social media (of any form)
- how people from the target audience currently manage their diverse identities across social media
- people from the target audience's current pain points with regards to existing social media platforms

Through class activities, you will have developed an interview script on the above topics. Once you feel your script is sufficiently refined, I would like you to:

- **Conduct two interviews** based on your script with people from the target audience. Obtain permission to record them. Turn the audio recordings into textual transcripts. There are several services & tools that will automate this for you, use your search engine of choice to find one! (10 min.)
- **Conduct one observation or think-aloud session** of someone from the target audience using a competing platform in this space. Obtain permission to observe them. The person may be one of the people you interviewed. Take notes.
- **Analyse the data** from these three sessions. (5 min.)
- **Synthesise the findings** into design considerations.
- **Summarise your user research** in a 1-2 page report. This is what you will submit via the Moodle assignment upload interface.
