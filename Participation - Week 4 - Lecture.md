# Participation - Week 4 - Lecture

## Participation

Def: directly engages audience in creative process so that they become participants

sidebar
socially engaged practice:
often participatory

Start:
early-to-mid 20th century,

movements:
- dadaism
	- ww1, somewhere in Europe
- situationism
	- countering isolation of capitalism?
	also around ww1?
- "happenings"
	- more playful,
	- came from situationism
	- gave rise to performance art

## ruangrupa

From Jakarta

Providing space, crucial to ruangrupa
about making community
fusing art & life
word for sharing resources

## Lygia Clark
brazilian
lived in Paris
escaping military dictatorship

focus on healing
(not necessarily socially engaged, but is healing social?)
considered her practice more as therapy than just art

relational
sensory

Lots of works involving people interacting together through the art

## Roundtable Peeps

### Ralitsa Doncheva
(she/her)
filmmaker

poetic approach to documentary

**Fly, Fly, Sadness**
transition between music and fire, very stylised

Documentarianism & participation?

### Sarah Wendt

dance, music, sculpture
invites public and collaborators to dance and create (and scream) with her

SCREAMING!

### Angelique Wilkie

associate professor of contemp. dance
task force on anti black racism

presence and performativity to extend boundaries of authenticity and privacy

Confession Publique
trailer: disconnection between sound and actions

## Roundtable

### Doncheva - to what extent did you have to participate, how did that change your perspective as a documentarian?

context:
festival of national costume
Bulgaria
every summer, on top of a mountain
symbolic escape from modern life

2 rules
- have to wear a traditional fol custom
	- embroidery
	- costume
	- relates to place
- no modern tech
intimate
not observer

Goal:
sensuous cinematic experience
dislocating, dreamlike world
not a direct "objective" picture
finding language or cinema techniques to reflect feeling of place and her experience being there

to film dances, need to be in it, the rhythm
chose to only film handheld
only analogue cameras
10 minutes filming max
expensive, limited film stock
-> spent most of the time being there

limitations -> restraint -> awaken senses -> new point of view

### Wendt - What is it about participation that attracts you to it? When does it go well or wrong?

Work often very collaboration based
didn't see it as participation as much as collaboration
subtle difference

**scream choir**
yes saw it as participative
more nuanced than our screaming
a bit of rehearsal
**choosing** to be there, knowing in advance

quelque part dans l'inachevee
Failure is built into participatory

Sandra: 
There is a loss of control you need to accept,
recent work a lot of sci-fi type scenarios, losing control of environment

### Wilkie - private space, mixing private and public, tell us about personal dramaturgy, how it invites participation, how interdisciplinary leaves room

What do we understand as participation
doesn't think about own work as part.

personal dramaturgy
dramaturgy of the performer
topic of interest to her
in contemp. dance, performance generates material that will be on stage
how do performers relate to propositions from choreographer?
personality, morphology, social inscription ^
dramaturgical potential already present, harnessed as grounding for performance

Confession Publique: choreographer creating based on personal dramaturgy
to a certain extent private, but inherently not as piece of theatre

most important: building bridge with audience
we all have this private thing, even if not exposed
"whole other ball of wax" - love this phrase
on stage she can invite everybody to reflect on ownness

Sandra: 
overlay between inside and outside,
how does inside and outside interact, exchange
membrane
work of everyone: snapping membrane, space between private and public

challenge of live performance: in inviting audience into reflective personal space
the readier she is to be in that space, the easier it is

With aging it gets easier to be our own ownness
important to remember in such a youth-obsessed culture

### Doncheva - power of folk clothing?

Certain connection between ancestors when wearing clothing passed down
joyful sense in costume festival
*is there a similar connection when wearing clothing of a particular style? Goth, punk clothing, what connections are we making with those movements*

### Def. of participation

**Wilkie**: again, doesn't think of participatory
does think of exchange
whether fully or just witnessing
why have we formalized this fourth wall so strongly?
she wants her art to be something that moves something
encounter, bridge, provoking

**Wendt**: similarly no def.
all had a sense of kinesthetic exchange
can be very little happening, but at least we're all witnessing
inherently participatory
fave. ex. of participatory viewing:
sculpture, Rube Goldberg mach.
sand sculpture 
hole that lets sand out, **activation point**
20 audience members invited into room in near darkness
witnessing passing of time, falling of one object
all together

**Doncheva**
exchange, encounter, vulnerability
how does she as an artist get into that vulnerability?
v comfy behind a camera,
broken out of comfort by destabilizing, discomforting element

### moments when things don't go the way you expected
we collaborate with chance
loosening, blunting of desire for a specific outcome

Conf. Publ. point declencheur is Angelique
in rehearsals, constant struggle to get more unknown things
open your mouth and figure it out with what comes out
diff. relationship with success
the moment she goes out and asks, is this going well? -> that's a failure
challenge = **stay here**
"audience is witnessing me witnessing myself"

Angelique never sees the end result
it's not for her, well it is but it isn't 
it doesn't matter if people like it, it just has to make people feel something

Ralitsa does have to see it
experience of seeing it is v different for her, depending on the circumstances around which she watches it
all work, even sculpture, painting, material work, all is **never complete**
