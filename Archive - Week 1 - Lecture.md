# Archive - Week 1 - Lecture

## Keywords; a reminder

Many types of **keys**, familiar
Keywords **unlock**, cypher, map
Used constantly, understanding in static way impossible

Semester 1:
- Framing
- Engaging
- Working

Semester 2:
- Archive
- **Care**
- Home
- Participation
- **Nature**
- Failure
- **Magic**
- Time
- Information
- **Body**

Inhabiting key cultural concepts,
shape work within and with them

### Interdisciplinarity
interaction across and between disciplines
=\ synthesis or disappearance of discipines
emerges through interferences

## Archive

object, goal = **organise & store** media
Proclivity to store and receive
Connected to memory
**Medium** (of storage) in and of itself 
Dialectic between **storage and retrieval**

### non-literal archives
Ex. work from last semester
- Practitioner statement
- Critical Review
- Tutorial hosting tasks
- Notes
- Drafts
- Feedback
- Inspiration
- Slides

#### Julietta Singh - Body as archive
Archives **not always physical**
Ex. body
- memories
- scars
- fillings
- DNA
- Inherited experiences
Inside and outside
Blend into each other, 
**bleed out**, not contained

**What is your archive?**
Practitioners in Academics always asked this

For an art practitioner:
- work
- research
- drafts
- information on artists' life
  - opinions
  - life experiences
  - habits
- cultural information
- historical information

Art historian:
- not only works of period
- articles
- critiques
- life on 

### What is my archive?
Based around keyword: The Body
freewrite; write out your archive in relation to keyword:

```
Pleasure and pain, blood and heart. A visceral, disgusting, beautiful crossroads.
I've explored it myself in different shades of bruised, molten flesh.
I gravitate towards new ways of being horrifyingly enchanted by bodies.
We are all flesh
Memento Mori
Hannibal, Anatomy, Men, Annihilation, Swiss Army Man, Clipping, Dusty Ray, Nicole Dollanganger

Undoubtedly, it's something I think a lot about. In the ways I negotiate with my body.
Cutting or pulling hair out
Cutting
It's so easy to love others' bodies but so much harder for our own, to face our archive and experiences.

My archives: digital data, knick-knacks, records, plushies, media

What about CARE:
I obssessively care for my archive. I store digital data I haven't accessed in years.
I remove records from their sleeves so slowly, never touching hte music directly.
I spend a minute cleaning the sides of the record to remove as much dust.
It is futile. By the very act of playing, the record is degraded.
It's so much work to play a record, and yet
I keep going
Is it an act of love?
Self destruction?
```
