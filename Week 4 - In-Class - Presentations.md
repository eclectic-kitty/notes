# Week 4 - In-Class - Presentations

## Endless Chain

Media company mopolies
Not only do diff. companies own each other, but
The same people serve on boards of different companies
Endless chain of influences

## Video Games and Computing Holding Power

Hold games have over people?
Wants nuance in debate

Not **mindless** form of entertainment
Requires complex skills
Pac Man
- ghost patterns
- reflexes

Jarish's perspective
Escaping negative emotions through games
All have strategy to discover and master
Part of the story

## GNU Manifesto

GNU project to prove free software can work
spurred by installation of closed source software on MIT computers

Valuing collaboration, freedom
Allowing users to personalize their software

## Using computers: A Direction for Design

facilitating human interaction with computer systems

ontology
breaking down pieces of a system

Domain
Specific, limited area of application and understanding
ex. steering system vs. steering wheel

Goal is for users to only be aware of their own domain

Breakdown
Something prevents user from doing what they want

Breakdown corrections
Providing course of action
within user domain
You want adaptive tools, can be applied to different frameworks

What do our tools say about us?
We tend to anthropomorphize
muscle memory
Ease and range of communication is more and more valued

## Six Elements and the causal relations among them
6 elements of drama, applied to computers!
written by game designer

6 el. established by Aristotle

interactivity in theater not all that successful
More of a distraction

Action -> 
Character -> groups of traits, inferred from pattern of thoughts -> both human & computer origin
thought -> processes leading to choice -> both human & computer origin
language -> words -> signs, visual comm.
melody -> things heard, musical speech -> pleasure sensations, patterns
enactment

## Classification of Tele-COmmunication

different methods of sharing info
4 classes:
- allocution
	instantaneous, one-way, emphasizes hierarchies
- conversation
	mutual exchange, assumed one-on-one but can be middlemen (ISPs)
- consultation
	libraries, at receiver's convenience
- registration
	
## Siren Shapes: Exploratory and Constructive Hypertext

Less hierarchical
closer to mind

constructive:
in process of creation
designed for scriptors

Exploratory:

Relationship between author and reader, roles
reader becomes collaborator

transclusion

## Soft Architecture Machines

Trying to solve(?) relationship between architect and user

### 1st excerpt
Human-computer interactions
Not good at interpreting each others' intentions
Failure of communication

New approach: knowledge of each other
Computer needs knowledge of us, our intentions, context
needs model of user
& model of our model of it
& model of our model of it's model of us


### 2nd excerpt

Our approach?
user of house can learn what they want out of house

indigenous approach
communal, impact on all users, broader community

Architecture machine? Bridges gap between what user wants & what community wants
envisions network of communications

## The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Hapitat

Habitat: online multiplayer game
Developed by Lucasfilm (now Lucasarts)
Source of many concepts now common
virtual world (*really?)
User content geenration
Virtual economy
Moderation

social experiment
tool for research and education
exploring user-created content

Technical issues:
limited number of users
Limited accessibility
Network issues
High cost

## The Fantasy Beyond Control
Lynn Hershman Leeson
Intermedia artist
Created early interactive works
focus: Lorna

About woman with Agoraphobia
Sits at home and watches TV all day
Viewer controls with a TV remote

Deep Contact
Touch screen interactive pieces
Touch different sections of woman's body
Different narrative sections

Nature of control
Are you controlling it?
Is it controlling you?

## Seeing and Writing

Mechanical letters
mechanization of writing
replaced handwriting
identical reproduction

Electronic letters
computer allows more experimentation in typefaces
word processing, more freedom
Impermanence
Typography can deteriorate, everyone their own designer

Electronic page
layout flows from decided typeface
Computer windows 2.5 dimensions
Hypertext

Pictures in text
Images and text interlinked for long time

## Two models of Privacy

tracking is a metaphor
entity traces a trajectory through abstract space, with numerous dimensions
computers can gather data, data doesn't mean anything to it
humans need to be in interaction to intervene with data
Not about data itself
About connections

Surveillance model
Typical cultural idea
5 componenets:
	- Someone is watching you
	- watching is continuous
	- invasion of privacy, home, familiar space
	- centrally stored info
	- Identified with state, consciously planned out malevolent aims

Capture model
Predictive
Undesrtanding human psychology
	- Turns human ctivity into data
	- assumption of active intervention from computer on human activities
	- Captured activities portrayed as constructed in real-time
	- Decentralized
	- aims not political but philosophical, monetary

## Nonlinearity and Literary Theory

Textual Topology
Formal structures
Govern: sequence & accessibility of script
script = visible words and spaces
whther manually or automatically

Tecton
basic element of textuality

scripton
unbroken sequence of one or more scriptons

Traversal functions
mechanisms that combine and present scriptons to reader
simpmle or 

Topology
Linear: scripton in one fixed sequence
nonlinear; Does not...

Dyanimcs
Intratextonic
content may change while number stays fixed
textonic
both content and number can change

Determinability
stability of traversal function
Determinate: adjacent scriptons the same
Indeterminate: not

User-functionality
explorative: user decides path
role-playing: user assumes strategic responsibility for character
configurative: textons or traversal functions designed by user
PoeticL usesr's actions, dialogue, design, aesthetically motivated

4 degrees:
1. simple nonlinear
textons are static, open, explorable by user
\2. and onwards went by too fast

John Cage used the iching in some performances

## Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance - Critical Art Ensemble

Where are we?
Life under capitalism after fall of Berlin Wall
Nomadic horde!
Scythians
attacked suddenly + without warning
The only things we know about them is from others writing about it

Illusion of presence
No fixed territory
Always on the offensive
speed and surprise
but
No garrison, no territory

Why Scythians?
Capitalism has fixed garrison issue
not real garrison, ideological garrison
society of the spectacle

Why are we still here?
Failed poetic self
Art always possible of being recuperated by capitalism
Inevitably leads to solipsism and mysticism
Disengaging

We do, unfortunately, live in a society
Impossible to fully check out
Hippies often brought over stuff

Modern capital too mobile and resilient to resist labour movement
If someone uunionizes factory,
factory moves
No more public streets, only roads and stroads

Solution?
Cyber-movement
Streets are now online, babyyy
nomadic, able to strike everywhere
instant

Why are we still here Pt. 2 Reloaded
Subverted corporate symbols don't subvert much
Disengage
Digital streets now look like the real ones
We don;t really live in the real world
No reason to not have international labour movement

## The World-Wide Web

Tim Berners-Lee

Created at CERN in early 90's
Allowing collaborators across vast distances
pool of human knowledge
displays document, links to other documents from server

Defining elements:
Address system URI: Uniform Resource Identifier
Network protocol HTTP: protocol for information transfer from server to user
Markup language HTML: used to structure elements of document
