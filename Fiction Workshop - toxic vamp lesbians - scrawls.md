# Fiction Workshop - toxic vamp lesbians - scrawls

"I think I still owe you some blood." - line from a journal entry

## Her apartment? - in-class exercise?
An old building that should've been renovated years ago. The floorboards are creaky, the awnings are a little crooked, there's cracks painted over. not a lot of windows. Decorated very cute, blankets and flags hung on the walls. The couch is covered in cushions, you can barely sit on it. The air is stuffy, no windows (or doors) have been opened in a week despite the temperature being fine

A cabin? A vacation?

A festival? Sunlight at its peak, people basking, laughing with friends, drinking. The crowd is loose, but loud, and everywhere.

She might be uncomfortable around others? She's lonely but hates crowds, doesn't like the sun, would feel observed from too close, would always feel like the ugliest/least cool person there.

## Single sentence exercise
The stranger drained the love from my neck in the dingy alley behind the bar.

## Character exercise
If she meets the vampire in a bar, what are her thoughts going into that environment? How does her perception differ from others?

The raindrops falling on her glasses bent the light from the bar's neon sign. Her arms felt heavy against her sides but the promise of cheap beer kept her going.

## Developing
I worry that making either of them angry kind of defeats the purpose?
On the one hand, it ends up making the vampirism far too allegorical.
I also think it's too obvious as a form of abuse. It's not hard to realise (from the outside at least) that you shouldn't accept someone demeaning you or getting mad at you. I think I liked the subtlety of how are either of them engaging with the act? Would Vic get carried away? Does Laura enjoy it or is she enduring it? The original idea came from **the horror of Vic realising how she's being used, how thin the line can be**

## Initial idea
A woman discovers that her partner of many years is a vampire. While initially horrified and betrayed, she begins to fantasize of drunk from. Not because she'd enjoy it, but because she feels like she deserves it. Her partner, horrified, leaves her, as she fears that if she would ever to lose control, her lover would simply allow herself to be drained.

## Related story
Curled up into a corner behind the bar, I'm too focused on the asphalt beneath me to notice you come up to me. I think I hear your voice, but not what you say. i look up and your gorgeous grey eyes draw me in. The moon hangs heavy in the sky. Your face moves closer to mine and I'm trapped in your headlights as our lips touched. Then yours are on my chin and under and on my neck and I'm brought back down in an instant as your fangs pierce my artery. I've never felt my body as much as when you're palming my breast and my thick blood is pouring down your throat.

"You looked so lonely in there, I just couldn't resist making sure your last moments felt good" I hear in my skull.

Hours later, empty for long enough that the maggots are eating their way through my eyes, the smile hasn't faded from my face.

### Comments
I definitely think the drinking has to feel good for Laura, it's not that it *isn't* pleasurable, but she's playing far too loose with her safety.
Maybe she's supposed to tell Vic when she starts feeling too woozy, but doesn't and Vic only just manages to catch how little colour she has left?

Yeah, I definitely think Vic needs to be relatively self-assured, making it all the more heartbreaking that Laura undoes this.

## Planning
I think I only really have room for one scene, probably them having sex

### Characters
- Laura
	- A shy antisocial 19-year old. 
	- Likes cute things, favourite activities are being at home, reading. Reads a lot of romance and horror. Studying creative writing.
	- Tends to engage with things a little obsessively. She doesn't go out of her way to find new things, be adventurous, but if pushed, she lets go of reservations and care and **loses herself easily**
	- Clingy, subtly demanding
		- She wouldn't get angry for not getting her way, but acts dejected
	- She has **always felt small**
		- She, in turn, is self-effacing as a result. Or is it the other way around?
	- She is choosing to be blinded to Vic's pain and boundaries by her self-destructive desires and the pleasure that comes with **oblivion**

- Vic
	- A recent vampire, 21. Naturally charming, especially since being turned. 
		- The confidence is a bit of a put-on, she's **faking it until she makes it**
	- Always been a **people pleaser**
	- Likes to go out to clubs (esp. goth). Studying computer science.
	- She is somewhat scared of herself
		- She is **all-too aware** of her own capacity to cause pain in others
	- She can't internalize that Laura might be ignoring the risk that accompanies being drained

### Context
~~Should they have planned the drinking? Does Laura already know? Or is it a surprise?~~
- ~~I like how it reads as a surprise in the previous bit, the sudden unexpected pleasure tinged with horror~~
- Then again, I like the idea of negotiating, having a plan, and Laura betraying the plan and I can still make it sound just as pleasant probs. 
	- Come to think of it if it's the first time, it can still have that tinge of surprise, horror, uncertainty
		- Trying something new is always a little scary
		- It's a brand new sensation

### Setting
Either way, I think this is happening in Laura's home.
A little bit of power and comfort is taken away from Vic
Very plush, comfortable, doesn't feel dangerous, makes her want to stay
Turns suffocating as she starts to realize

### Perspective
Are we in Laura's perspective or Vic's? or ~~omniscient~~
- ~~In Laura's perspective,~~
	- ~~Centered in the pleasure, fear abandon, all described in internal dialogue~~
	- ~~Trying to figure out why she let it go so far~~
	- ~~Pain in realizing how she's hurt Vic~~
- In Vic's perspective,
	- Centered in the betrayal and difficulty in holding herself back is described in internal dialogue
	- Difficulty in understanding why Laura didn't stop her sooner
	- I don't have to deal as much with what Laura is thinking consciously and what she isn't

### Final thots
I think the setting helps me decide on Vic's perspective
I also like the challenge of describing how Laura's body is reacting instead of merely describing that Laura is feeling good
I can also play with how physical responses between pain and pleasure are so similar.

Laura and Vic have been planning this for a little while
I think we should begin in situ, They are actively making out, taking their clothes off, something like that
Maybe not reveal what exactly is going on to the reader immediately
Same making out thing from the alleyway writing, turn, blood
Nice lengthy descriptions here
Feeling like it's been too long
Noticing a change in Laura's skin tone
She stops, worried Laura will go unconscious
Immediately goes to get her something sweet to drink
Not immediately thinking of the betrayal
Description of the room as she comes back turns
As Laura comes back, Vic starts trying to understand
Argument starts
Laura in denial at first
Self effacing pattern, starts to turn the issue on Vic
Vic has to remind herself what's going on, keep herself grounded
She has the moment of clarity.

Does she stay or does she leave Laura?
She can't bring herself to leave her, but flinches when Laura reaches for her, imperceptible to her.
