# Week 2 - Design Research

## Problem-space
Are we solving the right problem?

### Who are our users / audience?
- needs and goals?
- context?
- assumptions & expectations?
- preferences?
- current problems?

### Goal-oriented design research process
1. Kickoff meeting
2. Literature review
	- internal documents
	- web searches
	- peer-reviewed lit
3. Product / prototype and competitive audits
	- State of the art
	- Expert review
	- Compare to UX standards
		- careful with newness
4. Stakeholder interviews
	- Anyone w/ authority or responsibility
		- Any _impacted_ party
		- Could be the intended audience community 
		- ex. visually impaired community
	- Budget, schedule, technical constraints
5. SME Interviews
	- Subject Matter Experts
		- Authorities on product domain
	- Often expert *users*, not designers	
6. User and customer interviews / observation
	- users
		- People who use the product
	- customers
		- People who buy the product
		- ex. schools, companies, parents, etc.

### We embed knowledge in things

There is pre-existing knowledge that can be taken for granted when designing objects

Ex. toilets
Interesting because we don't like to talk about it
Japanese toilets operate v differently from North American ones
Glass bathroom stall doors that probably fog over

### Qualitative data can answer questions like
- Target users' current needs, expectations, behaviours
- Context, factors that play into problem (cocial, cultural, financial, pragmatic, historic)
- cont.

## Methods for design research

### Observation
- observing what peeps do in a  consienctioous manner
- peeps not good at accurately assessing own behaviours, esp. removed from context
- comes in various epistemological flavours, much of it comes from anthropology / sociology

eg. self-reported diet & exercise data so poor as measures of energy intake and physical activity that they do not hava justifiable place in scientific research - David Allison 2015

### Before u begin
- clarify objectives
	- who?
	- what?
	- why?
	- where?
	- how?
- mindset
	- be aware of own assumptions related to topic and subjects
	- *reality is socially constructed*

### Participant observation
Came from anthropology fieldwork method for understanding particular groups and practices through intense and close involvement with them *over time*

- Must have a role within the group, even if just as an outside observer
- Gate keepers control access
- *design as ethnography*

Makes more sense if you have *time*

### Direct observation
User does what they do without interruption in natural setting
	- observer goes to person
- high face / external / ecological validity
- observer is present and passively recording events as accurately as possible
	- Can include *objective* observations
	- subjective as well
- Best to observe over time (eg. day in the life)
	- Hawthorne effect (change from being observed) decreases over time
- make role known to participants
- do not interfere with participants
- commonly: HCI and usability

### Fly on the wall
Just go to a location and observe what happens there

ex. station yourself near self check-in stations and how different peopl euse them

Common: HCI, IxD

### General advice for observaation

- Tools:
	- pen & paper (sketch!)
	- camera
	- video
	- smart phone
- Obtain permission if it's not a highly public space and are not observing crowd behaviour
- Blend/merge with env. as much as possible
- Be prepared to change locations
- knowing participants or not makes a difference
	- ex. u know better when someone is lying
	- might not want to reveal some things to u
	- could be subconscious
- What to note
	- space
	- actors
	- goals
	- actions
	- objects
	- events
	- time
	- perceptions & feelings 
		- of actors & u

## Methods: think-aloud
Straight from the horse's mouth!

**Think-aloud protocol**
While interacting with software, *participants* verbalise their thought process to a *facilitator*

- key HCI method, origins in experimental cognitive psychology
- Bare bones instructions for participants
	- talk as if no one is listening
	- think aloud (as oppposed to explaining)
		- stop focusing on the use
		- might edit their thought process
- reminders from fcilitator if silence
	- "keep talking"
	- "what are you doing now?"
	- "mhmm?"
	- "and now?"

### Advice for think-aloud

- Ask fro permission to *record* the session: video is best, audio also good
- Be careful of social dynamics *you* set up 
	- ex. joking, sarcasm, nervousness
	- You don't want participant to try and please you because they want to be friends
- Don't bias the participant (don't talk about opinions)
- Don't get impatient
- Probe in a neutral way for info
- *Don't* expect participants to answer *design questions*
	- Can tell u what they want, can't necessarily know how to get there
	- It's *our* job to translate *need* into product or interface
- Prompting
	- questions, not answers
	- Hide own interests
- echoing
	- sets up social dialogue
	- not putting *your* words in user's mouth
	- (eg. - I dunno if the cooktop's on - You don't know it's on? - tricked into explaining why)
- COnversation disiquelibrium
	- trailing questions
	- signalling that you are there, you are interested in them
- summarise at key junctions
	- when new insight encountered - users may offer more detail
	- keep recording
		- Often you can't come up with anything until after!

### Caveats
- turns any task into multi-tasking
	- makes core task more difficult
	- person might choose *easiest* task (one that takes shortest time to report)
		- can happen subconsciously
	- person might choose to report on easiest task
- inevitably changes nature of task being performed
- alternative: retrospective think aloud
	- watch a video of participant after the fact with them
	- might lose detail

## Method: interviews
One on one discussion between interviewer and a subject
	- Interviewer steers conversation w/ questions
	- Interviewee steers converstion w/ answers

very flexible, can be used by interviewer for a broa drange of purposes
	- reflection on user experiencees (immediate and delayed)
	- interests related to context
	- past exp.
	- interface concerns
	- etc.

### Advantages
- Like Think Aloud, easy access to interviewees, relevant info
- Unlike, leaves freedom to interviewees, able to reflect more, complex connections
- Any veins of potentially interesting info brought up by interviewee can be pursued
- Misunderstandings can be caught and corrected
	- Hypotheses can be checked and confirmed

### Disadvantages
- interviewer role requires *skill*
	- some people aren't very chatty and need to be *opened* up
- Very mediated insight, responses are curated
	- What people say in an interview and what they do can be *worlds* apart
	- both observation and interviews can be used
- From perspective of interviewees, interviewers may misinterpret what was said

### Unstructured interviews
- Little is prepared in way of questions
	- might have topics, threads
- Shapes new questions in reaction to responses
- Well-suited toward early **exploration**
- Be aware of leading questions

### Structured interviews
- Prepare **agenda** of questions for interviews
- Not suited for early stages
	- very rigid
	- very specific responses
...

### Semi-structured Interviews
- Combination
- mix off following
	- script/list of questions
	- topics to discuss
	- ready to ad-lib over prepared agenda
	- shuffle ordering of topics
...

### Basics
- Clarify obj.
	- what?
	- why?
- Who are u interviewing?
- know the topic urself
	- if u don't know what it is, part. will drop detail 
- be aware of assumptions
- ask for permission to record audio
- For design
	- broad concerns -> **open** questions
		- why, how, can u elaborate
		- descriptive responses
		- richer data
			- description
				- stories
				- concrete examples
				- show and tell
	- specific concerns -> **closed**questions
		- what, where, who, yes/no
	- Interview as **funnel**
	- *Don't* make them do design work

### Question Types - Funnel!
- Introductory questions
	- Easy question to answer
	- Nonetheless provides detail
	- concrete description
	- eg. Tell me about how you met fellow students durin g pandemic
- Follow up question
	- like think-aloud
	- a nod, a pause, echoing
- Probing questions
	- Asking for further elaboration
	- Could just be "tell me more"
- Direct questions
	- directly introduces topics and directions
	- Could be uncomfortable, >
- Indirect question
	- Using projective questions to obtain opinions
	- Helpful for touchy subjects
	- Could allow interviewee to talk about themselves with a layer of separation
	- eg. Talking about how people in general struggled with mental health during pandemic

### Dynamic & thematic questions
- Dynamic	- Establish good rapport between interviewer and interviewee, ease in gently
- Thematics - gettin gsubject matter insights
- Need balance so peeps open up + thematic balance for data

# Class activity: interview
