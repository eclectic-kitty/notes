# Exhibition Essay - Prep!

## Notes from the exhibit

There's a busy sonic landscape upon entering the room. It's very dark. The (run-down) organic and irregular shapes of the houses strain somewhat against the simple pictorial design
The ties to our everyday spaces, opening theirs, interrogating home, "chez-soi" through memory, resistance, adaptation.

No hay dirección especifica. I'm looking along with the cut-outs. No entendía el layout de la cerámica hasta que oi de las montañas, pero aun asi las trate como un elemento del landscape.
Las montañas hablan con el viento y el oxigeno que pasa a travez de las hojas de los arboles.

"Los recuerdos son un privilegio del propietario."
Me encanta como el environment del juego sale del juego, la bocina arriba de mi, la textura del sillón en la banca, los posters con los modelos, la proyeccion sobre la maqueta de la casa, el mantel en el que estaba colocado el control. I loved how you disturb the space in the game, the sound from the other exhibits leaking in. The dog and cat are unintelligible. Me recordó a cuando visitaba México por Street View.

Las pantallas en el piso me invitaron a sentarme. Puedo oír a Luka jugando en la casa en Bogotá. Es extraño ver a este hombre hablar sin poder siquiera oír sus palabras. La silla vibrara debajo de mi trasero! Mientras oigo sonidos sin contexto. Mas memorias, objetos viejos con sus proprias historias. Una casa demolida mientras el hombre crea una estora

Resilience, memory, anima, community, landscape

## Brainstorming

### Requirements
- 800 words
	- (My own division)
	- 150 - intro
	- 550 - body
		- 275 per - 2 arg.
		- ~185 per - 3 arg. 
	- 100 - conclusion
- make a critical curatorial analysis that gives meaning to the works
displayed as an artistic narrative
	- begin with a visual observation that leads to the development of an interpretive thesis/argument
- Questions:
	- What is the statement of the exhibition?
	- How do these works form a curatorial narrative? 
	- Is there a work that was especially interesting in the way you perceived the exhibition?
	- What sources have influenced the artists?
	- Do you think the theme of the exhibition is relevant?

### Rambles!
Thesis??? 
We should protect our homes like mountains
We should preserve/protect our homes/memories
Community is an important part/tool for protecting our homes/memories
	- Sharing information/memories gives them life
	- Mutual support in our shared struggles against capitalism, imperialism, colonialism, etc.
	- Extends to our ecosystems, our geography, not just human actors

The initial (not just visual) experience I want to focus on is the way that the pieces are **presented not at all separately**. Nothing had its own room, there were no headphones to ever be fully immersed in just one exhibit. (closest thing was the rather directional speakers aimed from the ceiling, allowing you to be immersed while not separated.) Does that say something about the experience of diaspora? Recognizing our **common struggles** and the ways in which sticking together helps us overcome these struggles?

I could also focus on the **interactive aspect of each piece**, how they invite us to **place ourselves** in the location of each piece, to consider how our struggles to maintain our memories and homes aren't unique and that we benefit from community. Also the idea of how this allows us to communicate knowledge, to bring each other into our homes.

The least explicitly political piece, the one about the house in Bogota, nonetheless said memories were the privilege of proprietors. While it's certainly possible to make and hold memories without a stable home, there is certainly something to how this perhaps makes them more transitory, die sooner, less stable and longlasting, less able to pass them along. Again, diaspora, being separate from this childhood home (grandmother's) and feeling the need to recreate it digitally for preservation.

What were the Zapatista women asked about mountains?
They were asked if mountains are alive
Todas respondieron que si, aunque habian diferencias en si hablaban de la montaña en si o si hablaban de los animales, y los arboles, etc. que crecen en la montaña 
Why they can't speak if they're alive
Hablan a travez del viento, del bienestar de los animales y las plantas, nos dicen si estan enfermas
What they think of us
Nos ven con orgullo, depende de como las tratamos, etc.

The overall message here seemed to be about how we are part of our homes, about how a landscape and non-human entities are as much a part of our homes as we and the things we make are. It seemed to be about respecting others, respecting the mountain, learning from it. How you have to move around the mountains of pottery and dolls in the center of the space. How do we root ourselves somewhere and stake our claim to existence while still allowing for community? Reflected in how the piece makes the photos of the Zapatista women and the audience into part of the mountains on the screen. Tying to the revolutionary movement of the Zapatistas who seek to claim their own land and demand proper treatment from the government while doing their best to provide for themselves the services and rights the government denies them. As women, too, the need to stand one's own ground is even more important.

## Detailed Planning

### Thesis: The curatorial work of the exhibition argues in favour of community as a tool to protect our homes/memories/selves

### Intro (150): Initial impressions
- audio, openness of the space, darkness
	- Somewhat overwhelming
	- Still, inviting, curiosity
- confusion upon wandering around the Zapatista piece
	- Vague recognition, but separation
	- Unsure how I was meant to interact
- Somewhat similar to the feeling of entering someone's home and being overwhelmed at how their home smells, how it's laid out, the differences and similarities

### Par. 1 (250): The layout communicates that the boundaries between works are fluid and that there is no hierarchy
- Multiple gallery standards are rejected in favour of making the exhibition a more open, less hierarchical experience
	- No rooms!
		- Few walls
		- Lots of gaps between walls!
		- Multiple entrances/exits out of each exhibit's area
		- Neither exhibit at the sides is made out to be the initial one
	- Audio suffuses throughout space
		- No headphones, only directional speakers
		- Open floor plan allows audio to fade in and out
		- You are never immersed in any one exhibit, the others are always in back of mind
		- Invite you to make connections!
			- ex. The zapatistas talking about mountains, the way the San Basilio exhibit talks about anima, the strong tie of memory to the house in Bogotá


### Par. 2 (250): The interactive nature then invites the audience member, wherever they may be from, to connect to the experiences of the artists and their subjects.
- Each work has an interactive element beyond simply staring at something on the wall! These memories and struggles are not only shared with us, but we are invited 
- To put ourselves in their place (house, shadows)
- To meet them on their own terms (speakers, record player, navigating the ceramics)

### Conclusion (150): Personal connection
- Recognizing a lot of visual elements from No Me Demoro
	- Empathizing with some of these experiences
	- Recognition of my privilege while longing for these places
- Meanwhile, feeling more alienated from the other exhibits
	- My experience is certainly not that of a poor or indigenous person, and not even that of a particularly dark skinned Mexican
	- There's a mix of curiosity, pride, guilt, sadness, and anger in experiencing these works

## Extra scribbles
This initial uncertainty persisted I entered deeper into the space, beginning with the piece Zapatistas, which greeted me with seemingly disconnected mountainous displays of ceramics and hanging cutouts of Zapatista women. 


Thus, each audience member is free to make their own way through the exhibition.
