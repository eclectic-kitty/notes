# Class 6 - ?

## Intro, spiel about reading the bible from a critical feminist perspective
We are very much reading against the grain, it *is* a patriarchal text
But there are important women in it
There aren't many, but we do hear women's stories

Everytime we read a story, we are interpreting in our heads
The next time around, that interpretation adds to how we read it

One of our big problems is we have not learned to read *as* women

Some of the texts we're looking at are descriptive
Some of them are prescriptive
Ex. "It is not good for the human to be alone"
Ex. pain in childbirth
Is that descriptive or prescriptive? Opposition to the use of anaesthetics in childbirth

Is the use of gendered Hebrew language prescriptive or descriptive?

We are suspicious,  not neutral
We don't blame, but we seek to decentralize, to destabilize the story
Looking at the text, subtext, pretext (why is it here? What is its placement?), the context, the *texture*

### God & gender
Very often, God is attributed maleness
He's often even called a father
But God is never attributed gender in the bible
He is however at some point compared to a mother

**Tamar**
What was conceivable for her in that time?
What were the issues then?

**Book of Esther**
Incredible that the book is named after her
The holiday that celebrates him is to celebrate Mordecai
As the book is read, people stand up for sentences about Mordecai

something happened since it was written for focus to shift, to lose the ritual devoted to Jephtha's daughter

Do we ignore the text? Reclaim the text?
Hermeneutics (principles of interpretation)
You need to approach the text with suspicion
You don't reject or celebrate
Restoring history to women and women to history

Liberationist feminists

Phyllis tribble?
"We have to look at the bible as a wandering pilgrim...""

Biblical commandment to seek justice
Part of what drives women to interrogate the bible

Seeking voice of woman was not to make
To make the text speak to contemporary realities
To enable a text that would be non-patriarchal in a patriarchal world
Find sources that would add

What does reading it like this add?
Hope
We *can* read it differently
We can ask new questions
Imagine new possibilities
