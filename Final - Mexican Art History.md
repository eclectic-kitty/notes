# Final - Mexican Art History

## Q3 - Women in Mexican Art and Society
2021 was the most bloody year in recent Mexican history for women. That year, the country had a femicide rate of 6 per 100,000 women. That's six times the Canadian rate and twice the American rate in the same year. Over one thousand women were murdered that year. Like the general murder rate, this has been a particularly strongly felt problem in Mexico ever since 2007, the beginning of the War on Drugs in Mexico, launched by former president Felipe Cald√©ron.
