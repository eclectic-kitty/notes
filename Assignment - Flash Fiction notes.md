I first saw it, suddenly, as the forest gave way to an empty field. It rolled on, all the way to the horizon. I couldn't help myself. 
I stared into it.
Just for a second.

I was shaken back into focus by the interstate's grooved shoulder. I checked my rearview and side mirrors for headlights. I double checked my seatbelt while trying to keep my eyes fixed on the horizon ahead of me, where the road met the sky. I know I would never reach it.

It looms.

Some half a dozen kilometers back, when the trees retreated, it appeared far off on the horizon. It was a ghastly yellow reflected on the clouds, far larger than it should have been, far brighter than it should have been. It blinded me. It didn't seem to have any point of origin. It spanned nearly 180 degrees of the horizon on the right side of the car. I was filled with an inexplicable dread. It seemed to be as far away as anything could possibly be, and yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was getting closer.

So I drove. I haven't turned back to face it since I first noticed it. I'm focusing instead on the road and sky ahead.
