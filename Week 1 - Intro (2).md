# Week 1 - Intro

Middle ages:
Between the great migration of Germanic peoples and Christopher Columbus travelling to America
Thought of by most people as the dark ages
ending with the "enlightenment", aka europe colonizing everyone else
so, basically, the "dark" ages are when europe had the least amount of power

Conservative youth movement, practised by a lot of computer scientists
wargames
Avid consumers of speculative fiction
sword and sorcery, sci-fi
lord of the rings prior to all this, but paperbacks released in the 70's part of this
as personal computers became a thing, these wargame and sword and sorcery hobbies came together with roleplaying games, adventure games (shoutout colossal cave adventure)

why has medieval history and aesthetics become so intertwined with videogames?
Why are they so deeply integrated?

fish metaphor, one fish asks another about water and the other asks wtf is water
ideology = water
historical material conditions make people feel like a rational subject
Before we even have ideas, there are all these other ideas that are not allowed by our material conditions
action is where an idea comes from
