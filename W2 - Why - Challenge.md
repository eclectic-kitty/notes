# Why do we play games?
We often hear a lot about:

## Immersion
Are we being immersed in water?
What do people mean by immersion?
**The SCI Model** - *Exam!*
- **Sensory immersion**: Entering a new reality through our senses, ex. VR, visuals, (water)
- **Challenge-based immersion**: Cognitive immersion, flow state, becoming so focused on a challenge you don't do anything else
- **Imaginative immersion**: Similar to before, losign track of time, becoming focused, but this time in imagination, being so empathetic you live with characters 

## Challenges
Difficult vs. difficult but exciting?
The difference is framing
- Safety
- boundaries
- controlled consequences

### Why are challenges fun?
"Fun is just another word for learning" - Koster
Animals and children play games! A way to frame reality

### Uncertainty
**The lens of uncertainty** - *Exam!*
- Uncertainty of performance: Will you put on your best performance? WIll you be able to? Will your opponent?
- Uncertainty of perception: Will you be able to see the elements you need to?
- Human unpredictability: What will the humans around you choose to do?
- Complexity: Systems so complicated that it's uncertain what consequences your decisions will have, what the systems will do
- Chance: luck

Two types of challenge (and the spectrum between) - *Exam!*
- Skill
- Chance
Chance based things can still give you a sense of accomplishment, difficulty

### Challenges of skill (Ubisoft) - *Exam!*
- Mental skills 
- Physical skills: can be sports, but also dexterity (platformers, fighting games)
- Social skills: ex. lying games
General categories

Skills of Chess
- Assessing a situation (observation)
- Planning (considering many possible variants)
- **Strategy, tactics**
- "Mind Reading"
- Time management
- Memorization (of openings)

**Strategy vs. tactics** 
higher level vs. lower level

Skills of Soccer
- Assessing a situation (observation)
- Planning (considering many possible variants)
- Dexterity (legs)
- Stamina
- Team coordination
- Running fast

Skills of Spit
- Counting
- Sequencing
- Manual dexterity

### Game **costs** - *Exam!*
Honing and testing skills is what makes challenges fun
It's also the **player effort** required

Skill challenge **costs**
- Learning
- Failing
- Being judged
- Having to perform
- Repeating

Skill challenge **rewards**
- Progressing
- Improving
- Winning/beating
- Achieving
- Competence
- Confidence
- Reducing **uncertainty** - Metroidvania!

Balancing challenge?
Everyone comes from different places, is willing to do different things
One must keep things just right, not too hard, not too easy
In other words:

### Flow
The psychology of optimal experience
In what conditions are people most happy?
It turns out it's when people are active!
Keywords:
- exhilaration
- stretched to limit
- difficult, worthwhile
- not immediately pleasant
- mastery
- determining content of life
- controling consciousness moment by moment
- individual efforts and creativity

Phenomenology of enjoyment:
- chance of completing task
- ability to concentrate
- clear goals
- immediate feedback
- deep, effortless involvement, removes awareness of worries and frustr. of life
- control over actions
- concern for self disappears, reemerges after
- time distortion

Competition is only fun as long as it does not take precedence over improving one's skill
Without the appropriate skills, a challenge is meaningless

Channel of flow between anxiety and boredom, depending on level of challenge

Against flow? 
Braxton Soderman book, critiquing flow state and how it can be used

### Balancing challenge
Difficulty is subjective
- One should define a target player
- Include difficulty levels
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Difficulty from other players: matching the right players

More on dynamic adjustment: Can be felt as if game is letting player win, kid

Paradox of the player:
Motivated by a game because of challenges and uncertainty
At some point, once a player is skilled enough, they can beat challenges easily and push back uncertainty
The game is no longer interesting

- Dominant strategies
- Solved games
Ex. Tic Tac Toe

## 7 Up
micro moments
Happening to pick up a card you need!
Fun coincidences!
Chain reactions

Macro moments
Positive feedback loop of having less cards to flip
Negative feedback loops of having less useful cards

Pure chance, like flipping a coin, but it maintains fun on seeing how it ends up

Flipping a coin over 50 minutes
- Suspense
- Pacing
Unpacks, unfolds chance

## Chance & Skill
Caillois four types of games
1. Agôn - Competition, skill-based
2. Alea - Chance (diametrically opposed to Agôn)
3. Mimicry - Imaginitive play
4. Ilinx - Playing with sense

There's been a Historical divide skill vs. chance
Christianity did not like chance games (especially)
(Each roll of the dice invokes Destiny, God, inundating Him with pointless requests)

But how we *feel* can be different
Winning chance games feel like an achievement
Kids feel skilled and cry, gamblers have superstitions - **agency**
Counting cards, understanding probability

### Challenges of chance
Making decisions in unpredictable context
Comitting to Fate
Calculating chances, balancing risk
Surrendering control

### Rewards of chance
- Exciting suspense
- Feeling lucky
- pleasant surprises
- surprising outcomes
- Shadenfreude
- Not responsible for failure
- Equality of players
- Letting go

Aside: Martian Dice

## Motivations
**Intrinsic vs extrinsic** - *Exam!?*
In-game rewards vs. outside rewards
progressing, winning vs. money, social, recognition
Can play together, ex, soccer can make you more fit, which can be rewarding in and of itself or can play into image of yourself

Wrap-up
Exchanging in challenges with framing, safe
There are rewards and costs involved
Chance is often an ingredient
Can be a challenge via managing risk and reward
