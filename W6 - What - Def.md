# What is a game?

A game is a set of rules or systems one chooses to engage and interact with in such a way that they have fun.

What is fun?

Autotelic (Telos: goal)

Goals?
Medium?
Only for fun or not?

Games theorists v recent
Used to be only ppl who hated games who would talk about them like this

Encyclopédie : first one had only gambling

Are theatre plays games? They're called plays, en français, to play = jouer

## Definitions throughout times

Huizinga, *Homo Ludens*, 1938
- Play is free, as in fact freedom
- not ordinary or real life
- distinct to such as to locality and duration (magic circle)
- Play creates, is, & demands order, absolute and supreme
Life is digital scary etc. so order is nice, safe
- No material interest, profit from it

Caillois, *Les jeux et les hommes*, 1958
- Free: Huizinga
- Separate
- **Uncertain**: difference from Huizinga
- Unproductive: creates neither goods, nor wealth (avoids removing gambling, as same amount of money comes in than comes out)
- Governed by rules
- Make-believe: special awareness of a second reality

Suits, *The Grasshopper: Games Life and Utopia*, 1978
- Prelusory goal: attempting to achieve a specific state of affairs
- Lusory means: using only means permitted by rules
- Constitutive rules: rules prohobit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means
Goal in golf: get ball in hole, one could just walk over and put it in there, hitting ball w/ sticks is inefficient but fun
- **Lusory attitude**: rules are accepted bcuz they make 

Chris Crawford, *The Art of Computer Game Design*, 1981
- representation: closed formal **system**, represents a subset of reality
- Interaction
- Conflict
- Safety: Results of a game are always less harsh than what game models
First digital games began to exist and influenced this book

Salen & Zimmerman, *Rule of Play: Game Design Fundamentals*, 2003
- "A game is a *system** in which players engage in artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome"
- We have a goal
- It's artificial, like a representation

Jesper Juul, *The Game, the Player, The World: Looking for a Heart of Gameness*, 2003
- Rules
- Variable, quantifiable outcome: uncertainty
- Player effort
- Player attachment to outcome
- Negotiable consequences: safety, artificial, new: negotiable, people decide to partake

Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations*, 1953
- What do we call games?
	- Board games
	- Card games
	- Ball games
	- Olympic games
	- Etc.
- Don't say: there must be something common, because they are games
- Look to see what could be common between all, if there is anything
- Usually, not a single element, similarities, series of them
- **Don't think, look**

SLIDES, MISSING SOMETHING

Chris Crawford, *Journal of Computer Game Design*, 1990
- Stops defining games, starts excluding things
```
                Intertainments
								   /       \
   Interactive stories & Playthings
													/      \
												Toys & Challenges
													      /      \
													 Puzzles & Conflicts
																			/     \
														Competitions & Games
```
- Subtractive instead of additive definitions

## Videogames?
Computer game?
Digital game?
Digital -> discrete gategories, board games could be considered this
First arcade game not a computer game, as the circuit board had the program built-in, not programmable

Elements
- Software
- Hardware
- Audio-Visuals
- Narrative
- Game

## Play vs. Game?
Play is free movement within a more rigid structure
No rules or systems, just being able to do whatever you want, it's kind of meaningless
You can also have a game so strict where there's no play

Caillois
continuum between two opposite poles
**Paidia <-> Ludus**
Paidia is the playfulness of youth, roleplaying, pretend <-> ludus is rules and structure, involves performance

Paidia, frolicsome, impulsive, exuberant, anarchic, capricious, is binded with arbitrary, imperative, purposely tedious conventions. Impractical, requires greater amount of effort patience, skill, ingenuity

Costikyan, *I have no words and I must design*, 2994
Will Wright: Sim City a toy, not a game
Balls have many interesting behaviours, it can be used in a game, but not inherent

If you find a toy, some element in a game engine that's fun to play around with, hold on to it

## Game vs. Puzzle

Schell, *The Art of Game Design*, 2007
A puzzle is fun and has a right answer
Once you find the right answer, the puzzle ceases to be fun
- Puzzle master Scott Kim

A puzzle is a game with a dominant strategy
- Schell

## MDA framework
Distinct components of games:
Rules -> System -> Fun
Design counterparts:
**Mechanics -> Dynamics -> Aesthetics**
- Componenets, data representation, algorithms
- run time behavious or mechanics, acting on input and output over time
- Desirable emotional responses in player, when interacting with game

**Recommendation**: Robert Zubek, *Elements of Game Design*
- Mechanics are game objects and actions that the player interacts with,
can be assembled into symptoms with specific properties
- Gameplay is the process of players interacting with game mechanics
- Player experience
- Similar ideas to MDA, but nuances

Jonathan's additional element:
**Meta**
- Social scaffolding that impacts the experience of the game
- Exist within context of culture

We are dealing with second order design
We design something, that leads to something else, that leads to our desired outcome
It's like we design a chair without being able to directly sit on the chair
