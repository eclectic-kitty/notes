# Week 2 - Reading - Bill Viola

## Introduction

interactive & non- video artists have developed approaches to thinking about new media more broadly
exploring new video tech, distinct qualities

**immediacy**
- surveillance footage
- live-streaming 
- video of audience

Bill Viola:
"70 mm video art"
lower cost of digital not primary attraction
*not sure I like this name, feels dismissive of digital*
production values: not rough
poetic
"represents tendency towards the lyrical in art" - Michael Rush

MIT Media Lab Aspen Movie-Map
video hardware hack?
mapped onto a navigation system, familiar
something already imagined
artists: defamiliarizing forms of interaction
beyond branching flowchart

**instruction manual, brochure vs poetry**

*I watched a couple of Bill Viola videos
(excerpt from The Raft, Tate video about installation in a church about martyrs. latter also showed bits from Tiny Deaths)
I remember seeing some of this in high school, project to create a moving painting
Showed as an example of lyrical, painterly quality to the video
I appreciated Tiny Deaths much more due to how it looked like video, was gritty, made obvious qualities of the medium
didn't love how martyrs were just displayed on vertical TVs, felt like there should be a frame or something?*

## Memory & experience

Existence is:
**continuous**, unbroken

Memory & sleep (and media):
provide impression that experience is broken up into parts
parts can be rearranged,
gaps can be projected into

**gaps**, forgetting is important
focus
early video art: record everything
current technology makes it easy to record, remember everything

memory technology has long history
mnemo-technics

## spaces and holism

Anecdote:
Japanese itako calling back spirits of the dead
imagining walking through a path at the temple
dead people are walked back through here for itako to communicate with them
recall them

These techniques presuppose existence of these places, **in their entirety**

These idea can extend to **data space**
Computer memory
Like steady-state field in brains
Something is **on** before approached
video cameras are always seeing, if not recording
*is this how cameras actually work?*

### digital

Data space is **fluid, temporal**
holistic
whole structures exist simultaneously
As opposed to **hard** copies
which are fixed in time
*How important is all this if we can really only perceive things one at a time?*

On digital, video has a **structure**
no longer seeing 1 frame
like poetry has the placement of words on paper
or music has a score
All visible at once

### knowledge
is considered to be additive
building things up piece by piece

One could also approach backwards
subtractive
One reveals bits and pieces of a whole
as they think the y build up

Anecdote:
western musician asking Gamelan musicians to run through a part of a piece
Lack of understanding, piece learnt as a whole

Art example:
video, one frame = one piece
15 years of work in < one minute
all at once

## structuralism & realism
*understanding things as part of a larger whole*

Viola thinks a return to structuralism is necessary
not that of the (70's?)
especially in experimental film
didactic, over-intellectualised
anti-content still somewhat valuable
moving away from **realism**
*really wish he gave more specific examples
I assume he's talking about surrealism, abstract, and conceptual art*

AK Coomaraswamy
Decadent art
not felt or energized
only denotes
no correspondance between form and representation
true art =/ compete with real world
*not sure what this is saying
seems a little contradictory? maybe?
what are the primitive or classic stages of that same sequence? (referring to decadent art?)*

AK
Western vs asian and christian art
Not trying to recreate moment
not seen through fram, window
rather continuous tradition
exists in mind and heart, proected into space
representing things as they are vs as they are in God, nearer their source

Art as **diagram**
*very cold word choice for this*
Renaisance = turning point in western art
Data space, structuralist ideas somewhat preserved
gallery space, palaces, cathedrals, physical storage

## digital + video art

interactive art pieces
**Unique path** through work
no more **master** edit
no more set speed
limitations: skill of producers and users, not tools
*Is the amount of work necessary achievable?
We still think in terms of a specific order
Beginning, memory, conceptualization of experience*

away from temporal **piece-by-piece** approach of program
camera, monocular, tunnel-vision focus
spatial
total-field approach
**carving out**
conceptual brain structures

## structures 

Recalling mnemo-technics
Tantric doctrine
energy diagram:
mantra and yantra
gemoetry and sound
**all equal**
data can be represented multiple ways

Types:
- branching
- matrix
- spaghetti

branching
**top-to bottom**
user choosing deviations
**footnoting**
free pace

matrix
popping in and out at any point
not literal space, idea space
all **directions equal**

spaghetti
getting lost within space
deeper into mind
**contradictory**

Fashion designer example
Using computer to:
- sketch
- bring up historical examples
- patterns
- communication

Travelling space & time

## Conclusion

Aspen city project map
*I looked it up, similar to Google Street View*
interesting example to Viola
Mentioned before as too literal, however

Too much returns to typical linear logic
Same structures mapped onto new technologies

Viola thinks further investigation is required in:
- relation between image and architecture
- structuralism of sacred art
- symbolic representation
- artificial memory systems

We must turn towards ourselves
develop selves
must precede development of tech
or we'll go nowhere
There **will** be **condominiums** in digital space
(cable TV)
Applications of tools are reflections of users
*hey this opinion was mentioned by Jhave in class after construction of change reading*

Porcupine and car fable-ish
Someone driving along highway
porcupine in road
begins to attempt to intimidate car
narrator turns off car
porcupine believes it's won
leaves, self-confident
inflated world-view

## Reflections, connections, opinions
