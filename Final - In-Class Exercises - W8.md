# Final - In-Class Exercises - W8

### Write 3 research questions, merge them
- How are the nostalgic elements in the artworks discussed being used? Is it reflective or restorative? Is there a uniting reason for why they're there?
- How does the use of nostalgia in these works compare to the use of nostalgia in broader or more traditional culture? Are the aims, methods, or impact different? Is it a coincidence?
- Has there actually been a change over time? Is this phenomenon recurring, constant, or something wholly new? If there is a change, what has driven it? Is it technology? Philosophy?
- What disturbances do these ghosts cause? What has died?
