# Week 3 - Prototyping

Prototypus: First example
So many different ways of doing so, sketching for ex.
One can't expect to immediately land upon the best way of doing something

### Apple paper
- look/feel
	- Don't work, but very polished visually
	- Don't have to be super high fidelity
- role
	- Tells the story of the thing
	- what is it like to use the thing?
- implementation
	- functional prototype

Obvs, u can integrate both kinds of prototypes!

### Fidelity
low
mid
high

As you get higher fidelity, it takes longer to make the prototypes
But you get more specific information

Types of fidelity
visual
breadth
depth
interactivity
data model

Most important thing prototypes do:
Answer a question!!!
