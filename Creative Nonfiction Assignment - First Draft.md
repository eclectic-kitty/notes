# Creative Nonfiction Assignment - First Draft

Plum ink flows out of the veins in my wrist and into the page's fibers. It's been weeks since I heard my name leave your mouth. 
"I really did want this."
It knocked to the ground and I had to tear the phone from my cheek. I prayed that my tears and gulps of air couldn't cross the invisible phone line. It's been months since your smell faded from my pillow. And still

I couldn't for the life of me remember what I was talking about, so I asked you about what you do when you're not writing about Robin Hood for school and you tell me about how your merino wool. It takes a long time before you have enough to knit anything, but you enjoy the process. Also, you're pretty sure you'd be drowning in sweaters and scarves otherwise.

It's probably not incredible for my recovery for me to be up so late, but I only have a few songs left to remove from the playlist and you're leaving tomorrow. There's "nothing quite so poison as a promise." (Case, Hell On) I wish I had thought to move the flowers into my room, but instead they died on the kitchen table, looking down onto the street below.
