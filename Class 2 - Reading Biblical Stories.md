# Class 2 - Reading Biblical Stories

## Distortion
When we're looking at women in the bible, we're distorting it
Not looking at the major stories
We're ignoring what the bible is trying to tell us about
Even the characters we're looking at, we are taking out of context, out of their subordinate pace

We are also looking at the bible as literature

## Meyers reading
This archaeological perspective gives us insight into domestic life during biblical eras

Also looks a bit at the text itself
Counts known names in bible, just 111 women vs. 1315 men
Early genesis long genealogy list consisting of (mostly) men

In the world of patriarchy, we don't ask why weren't women named, we ask why are *these* women named?

Women were fully involved, at every level, in the family's affairs, shepherding, advising others, shared participation
agriculture, preparing, preserving, tools, clothing, 

Miriam advises parents, others, sharing with her brothers
Listed as one of the three that saved Israel

In Deuteronomy, rebellious child, mother and father give judgment

What do we find in the text?

## Frymer-Kensky reading
She organizes biblical stories about women into 4 categories:
- victor
- victim
- voice
- virgin

Norma feels she's reading somewhat intertextually and isn't sure they all quite work

Bathsheba,
posited by Frymer-Kensky as victim, but she does later fight for her son to gain power

Typical situation, husband chosen by father
woman could be subservient, but she could choose to dishonour the family, or threaten to do so, etc.
perhaps not power, but influence

theme of favouritism? didn't quite get this
transformation throughout stories

### subordinate, but not inferior
parallels, placement of women in bible vs the book of judges
there, people consistently fail, sin, etc.
parallel between women and the people
women start out ok, end in a bad place
interpreted lesson: women shouldn't be treated that way because the people at large shouldn't be treated that way


### virgin
does not necessarily mean someone who hasn't had sex
but rather, not being married
bible not terribly concerned with premarital sex, rather with extramarital, adultery
second worst sin after idol worship
disloyalty, to God, to partner

Rahab? prostitute, saviour of Israel
Rachav
Tamar, dresses like, acts like a prostitute, Jacob claims her to be more righteous
