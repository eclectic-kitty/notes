Keyword combination: "framing the body"

I chose this keyword combination because I wanted to explore artwork that reframes bodies so as to emphasize the ways in which they are not entirely within our control.

Pieces:
- Annihilation, film, Alex Garland
	- Annihilation presents bodies melding together, creating simultaneously monstrous and beautiful new forms. Barriers between bodies are broken in a story about the inevitability of change and the thin barriers between selves.
- Anatomy, videogame, Kitty Horrorshow
	- Anatomy presents a house that has grown its own body after years of abandonment
- Human Botany, film, Four Chambers
	- Human Botany is a prnographic film that presents body parts almost as scientific footage of 

Resources:
- Pouvoirs de l'horreur, Julia Kristeva
- Film Bodies: Gender, Genre, and Excess, Linda Williams
- Queer Theory, Meg-John Barker & Julia Scheele
