# Intro

### Why do we play games?
It can be a strange habit
- Why would one play Sudoku???
	
##### What was the last game I playhed?
- Celeste
Why did I come back to it?
- Familiar, somewhat comfortable
Why did I start playing it?
- Visuals, platformer, recommendation
- Jonathan: An act of seduction, interplay between visuals, genre, expected pattern, word of mouth

##### Classmate
- Elden Ring
Why did he play it?
- Story, escapism, Discovery of game mechanics
- Stories and escapism have a natural draw to humans
- Horror
- Horror vs. terror, 
 - visceral unspeakable feeling - gore and immediacy
 - creeping dread and imagination - nothing immediate
Friend
- Hated it, worst 30 minutes
- Different audiences 

### Transgression tangent
- It would seem that games allow a space to transgress and explore
- Counterpoint tho, it can lead to ruining other players' experience

### Drawing
- Basic idea of what drawing a face is
- Asked about learning to draw well
- - Beginners think about technique
- - Artists will think about how to see the world
- returning to face, proportions of a typical smiley face are off, elements are weird, people don't think about interplay
- Drawing a nose is often not necessary, shadows will suffice to suggest a nose

### Improving gameplay sensitivity
- People coming to games without a design background will just add elements they think games should have
- Not thinking about how elements play with each other

##### Becoming self-aware players
- Why does something work?
- Why does something not work?
- Observe the games you're playing
- Ask others why they enjoy games you don't
- Find out owhy players aren't connecting with your games

### Confessions of a chess player
- Jonathan plays **a lot**
- 730 games, playing regularly for 5 years
- Still not good at it
- Unique chess thing - specialized pieces

##### A chess moment
- Doing well
 - No big mistakes
 - Slightly higher level player
 - More eaten pieces
- But!
 - Only 1 min. left vs. 4 min.
- Moment of a pawn in danger
 - Rook could provide backup? Go!
 - Inadvertently left rook open to bishop >~<
 - And it was eaten! Despair!
- Just one decision can change course of game, cause so many emotions

##### And yet he goes back to it
- For first year, Jonathan did not win a single match
- Early repeated big failures show how bad one is
- but also how good one *can* be
- ELO rating
 - Accurate
 - Matchmaking 
 - Advancing takes a long time
- Thrill of beating an opponent is worth defeats, for Jonathan
 - "Maybe this time..."
 - Advancing in ELO

- Pure skill game
- Mistakes are always your fault
- Only uncertainty is other player's moves
- Highly complex (possibility space size > number of atoms on Earth)
- Amount of options moment to moment is not overwhelming
- **Hardcore** game
 - Rewards serious involvement and punishes casual engagement
- Ended up writing a paper about shift from Queen only moving to corner -> Queen moving the way she does today

### Solitaire
- Platform of a deck of cards
##### Moments of pleasure
- Seeing a full stack of cards - satisfaction
- - Games can present order in a way real life often doesn't
- Revealing a card - mystery revealed!
- Why is this game played **so** much
##### <-
- Accessibility is very low
 - Widely available
 - Simple rules
 - Not a lot of judgement
- Default game on Windows
- Most convoluted way to sort a deck
- People mad about Solitaire can be unwinnable
 - But, maybe it can be an excuse for losing -> key to making casual games
- - An exploration of fate -> identifying signs of a good hand
 - Solitaire seen as *roguelite*?
