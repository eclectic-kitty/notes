# Final - Requirements

Writing is a mode of research-creation with words, grammar, structure, and content as materials. For this final project pathway, choose your keyword formula and research three cultural works that relate to their suggested method and application. Arrange them in a logical order and write an exhibition proposal that describes each work, explains their context, and argues how they relate to your exhibition theme (eg. FRAMING THE FUTURE). Lecture content and prompt exercises will provide you with building-blocks towards this essay. 

Given the nature of this essay, you should imagine yourself in the position of a curator who has a particular place and audience in mind for this “imagined exhibition.” You are hosting a story to be told with these works and their makers. 

Include an intended site for your exhibition that is appropriate to the content (both the works and the theme. This can be a digital exhibition/festival/etc). One work can be Winter semester course content; the other two must be researched and written about by you. 

Choose works that you can visit/have visited and/or for which you have solid documentation.

## Requirements
- 1,300 – 1,500 word essay, double-spaced, using 12-point font, with an introduction, body that positions works as primary resources (what is it, context, what is it doing in relation to keyword/other works in essay) and conclusion.
- A title page with your name and student number, TA name and course number, and a creative title that is not the same as this assessment brief (not part of word count)
-  At least 3 citations, correctly cited using Chicago style, notes & bibliography
	- Remember to set up, deliver, and apply your quotations
	- everything you quote from should be cited in a footnote
- At least 3 images captioned in your text
	- Refer to critical review for captioning
- At least 5 RELEVANT resources that you have consulted and decided are reliable, listed in Chicago style in a bibliography at the end of your paper
	- this does not factor into your word count
