# Final - Brainstorming

## Q2 - Public Space
The public space has undergone significant transformations, becoming an essential medium for Mexican artists to address and challenge political and social issues. Many movements have used distinct strategies to engage with audiences and the art establishment. Choose at least two of these movements and analyze how they reconfigured public spaces and audiences through their artistic approaches. Discuss how these strategies served as forms of agitation, negotiation, or reflection on historical, social, and political contexts. Illustrate how public space was appropriated and transformed into a site of mediation or contestation. Support your analysis with examples of specific artists and artworks.

### Possible artists
- Treintatreintistas
- Proceso Pentagono
- Grupo SUMA
	- I love the way they print on other materials
	- Especially that IBM punch card
		- Lots of room here for researching the role of computer companies at the time
		- Maybe some kind of reflection with their role today?

## Q3 - Women
Surrealism opened new opportunities for Mexican women artists in a predominantly male art world. These artists not only established their presence in the local artistic scene but also paved the way for the evolution of women’s artistic expression throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. The contributions of women were pivotal to the development of the avant-garde, feminist groups of the 1980s, and neo-conceptualist art addressing issues such as the war on drugs and the rise of femicides. Choose two specific examples of artists and artworks to discuss how the work of women artists was perceived and how they used their personal experiences to challenge the role of women in Mexican society. Explain how art became a means of political denunciation for gender and social issues.

### Possible artists
- Frida Kahlo
	- Lots of interesting stuff here about how her work has been appropriated by capitalism and liberal feminism in modern day
	- Connection to how her work was appropriated by the surrealists of her time
- Remedios Varo
- Leonora Carrington
- Lorena Wolffer
	- Could contrast with the way that Wolffer is more confrontational
	- From her earlier performance art to her more recent work seemingly focused around slogans, ads in public spaces
- Teresa Margolles <3
	- I want to write about her because I find her subtle way of introducing death and politics to be so fascinating
	- The way she makes the emptiness so felt
	- Not sure that Margolles engages as much with feminism and womanhood as the others
	- She seems more interested in narco deaths in general
	- As these kinds of deaths affect marginalised people more maybe there's something there?
		- The work with the embroidery feels like my best link here

The point *is* to compare

So Teresa Margolles / Lorena Wolffer is def the way to go, locking in!


**organizing thot:** Maybe the answer to the question of how do they challenge the role of women, what connects them, etc. is the way in which they confront people who might otherwise be comfortable in their assumptions that violence against women is no longer a thing? Wolffer in the street? Margolles in galleries, connecting work between Mexico and 1st world countries (drops in Australia, plinth in the UK)

### more focused:
- Margolles: Utilizes the gallery space in a way that she makes absences felt, palpable, but subtle. The social reality for these women and the absences felt there are brought into relief through haunting, abject, uncanny - again, palpable but subtle
	- absence caused by death
		- deaths, ofc, of marginalized people
		- i.e. poor people, *women*
	- also absences caused by the erasure of marginalized realities
		- ex. night club floors
		- women, trans, sex workers
	- **absence** of the marginalized
		- absence is important because it is key to this subtlety
		- it's more than possible for someone to experience on eof her works and not realize what it means (utilizing conceptualism's flexibility and vagueness)
		- nevertheless, there is something wrong with her work, it feels like there's nothing there, or at least that there should be more
		- representing how so many people live in a state of willing ignorance
		- ie this absence is felt
		- hopefully, driving one to investigate, and then to learn the truth that they have been suffused with this absence, with death
	- possible theories to connect to
		- globalization
		- no-objetualismo
		- necropolitics
		- gore capitalism
		- abject
		- hauntology???
			- Doesn't quite directly apply in either the Derrida or the Fisher sense
			- Both have to do with haunting, erasure of barriers, traces
			- but, the time scale is different, more human than societal
			- also the loss is more direct: death, real ghosts, not just economic condition
			- also, added spatial or class structure breaking
				- the audience is not those who have lost
				- rather it's those far away who ignore and benefit off that loss
			- that being said, there is a similar examination of the failures of neoliberalism and capitalism, much in the same way as Fisher, the failure to manifest of a peaceful future free of drug violence????
			- ---
			- There's also a section on ethnography that seems promising on Wikipedia
			- Seems to be about places where life and people used to be but have been abandoned
			- Similar to Juarez, which used to thrive but is a shell of its former self
			- ---
			- all of this goes back to women because as a further marginalized, group within the working class, they are particularly affected
	- Pieces to talk about
		- 
- Wolffer: I think I wanna cont
trast her by talking about how visceral and confrontational Wolffer is, all while touching on similar	 themes
	- Could also connect to hauntings? traces? The marks on her body, the phrases and words sourced from women

Pregunta para Nuria: quiero conectar el trabajo de Margolles a una historia mas amplia, en donde puedo buscar (articulo de The Guardian habla de como Juarez solia ser un vacation city para gente famosa americana)

At the end of the day, I might not need this much of a historical background

She often mixes elements form Mexico with those of the places she visits


## Reading notes
### Medina
- pg. 11 (pdf): Therefore, the pursuit of shock was replaced by the invention of conceptual forms of mourning, which were not only more subtle, but were in fact more amicable to contemplative reflection...
- pg. 14: the social and political crisis that authoritarian modernisation and economic integration produced in Mexico in I994-I995 also radicalised artistic practice.
- pg. 16: the most disturbing element of Teresa Margolles' forensic art does not lay in the horror of the images and objects she creates but in the institutional conditions which make them possible.

Overall gives me some of the only examples I've found of Margolles' earlier work with SEMEFO, which is definitely a lot more controversial

Argues that over the course of her career, she's moved from more blindly reactionary stuff, to things that have a political basis and are trying to make a political point about conditions in Mexico

### Root
- pg. 1: And this violence not only marks the body of the individual, but also the body of the nation.
- pg. 1: “Violence against women.” In what many are pleased to call the post-feminist world, this phrase almost seems to have a dated quality. Most of us are aware of the statistics about domestic violence and rape, as well as the inequalities in pay distribution and the like, but there remains a tendency to detach such statistics from the constellations of beliefs and attitudes that subtend them.
- pg 1-2: Wolffer is telling us that, at some level, we choose not to see; we prefer a kind of unconsciousness.
- pg. 2: It is easier to think of the extreme violence [...] as something that
happens to “them” [...]
- pg. 2: In a conservative society that tends to blame the victim for “provoking” the aggressor, Muros de replica was the first place many women had been able to make their truth visible.
- pg. 3: Wolffer reminds us that we’re all implicated. By embodying the interplay between what happens in the home and what happens in the world—and by bringing this embodiment into the street, she winnows the issues down to their key elements.

Foucault helping me connect the idea of things being presented in galleries!!!: "Foucault wrote that what takes place at the edge of empire reveals the nature of the empire."

### Lorena Wolffer. 14.04.2015 (interview)
- 0:00 - 0:55, complex relationship with art world
- 0:55 - 2:40, importancia de testimonio de primeras personas, trabajor con el cuerpo, questionar el rol de su cuerpo, como cabe dentro de un entorno social, salir del mundo del arte
- Up to 8:28, talking about how the art system, the government can swallow up attempts at resistance
- 8:28 - 9:35, struggles with the word "work" as she doesn't differentiate between art and intervention
- 9:35 - 12:55, empieza con una idea, y luego busca el formatio, form follows function ex. how to talk about domestic violence in a public space, led to 'encuesta', led to opportunity to do so at metro stations, metrobus stations, started with thinking where people concregate, esp. heterogeneous groups
- 13:50, the fundamental part of the work (encuesta) was the interaction between the women amongst each other, and with me
- 17:10-19:17, not interested in conceptualising as art-therapy, psychomagic, etc. therapy is based on the default state being good, or neutral at worst, therapy then comes in to fix the individual's issue and bring them back to default. Instead,  create new cultural practices, based on performance, what makes a woman is the repetition of the actions that make up a woman. 

### Conceiving a theory for Latin America: Juan Acha's Criticism
- Foreseeing the radical exchange of information through immaterial works, he called into question hierarchical artistic categories that demote design and the so-called popular arts, and criticized the supposedly natural contradiction between authentic avant-garde artistic attitudes and those of the economically “underdeveloped.” 
- Crucially, no-objectualismo did not signify a disdain for the object but rather resisted its fetishization

### Teoria y Practica" no objetualistas en america latina
- There is actually no such thing that is “purely artistic,” either as relation or essence. There has never been a purely artistic, scientific, or technological object. Every human product reflects the mind, the sensibility, and the basic needs of its maker. As such, structures of different kinds coexist within each product and it is immaterial whether the artistic structure or a different structure prevails over the others.
- Capitalism was largely behind the dual game of promoting the pure art of geometrism on the one hand, and the applied art of design on the other. After all, it is crucial for capitalism to turn every product into a commodity and to replace individual manual labor with industrial-mechanical, waged labor in order to produce surplus value. 
- Post-modernist non-objectualisms will disappear or be transfigured. But their reason for being is to make us aware of the evils of the mass media and of the goodness of the ephemeral, which is life and the process of change.
- The use of the starkest and most concrete realities of space and matter, movement and time, light and color, is another of the goals of postmodernism. Because anti-illusionism is anti-formalist by nature, and as such, non-objectualisms renounce presenting realities in terms of their forms. They renounce this in order to highlight the human actions and concepts of the reality that is presented, referred to, or signified.
- Even so, the most important aspect of postmodernist non-objectualisms is the fact that it destroys our Renaissance and humanist legacy and induces us to see and value the world in a more realistic and human manner.

### Toward a new artistic problematic in Latin America
- The main artistic problem in Latin America, in my view, is the non-formulation of concerns specific to us, those arising from our innermost third-world reality, which inherently implies mutation and transience.
- As we know, the developmentalist aesthetic follows foreign models and essentially boils down to merely attaining the high art of other worlds and popularizing it in our own. [...] a kind of art that is considered inadequate if not inappropriate for our time and its precocious forces, a kind of art that has proven spurious for a third world that is hungry for all manner of change.
- thot: while the exact perspectives are not present in Wolffer's work, the goal that Acha lays out I believe is
- Despite the fact that both impel art down the wrong paths, away from our legitimate reality and our self-determination, they are nonetheless necessary insofar as they correct each other, particularly when they begin to interact with a sociological approach to artistic matters.
	- Intellectualism
		- Artistic intellectualism advocates the predominance of the thinking man, conversant in the history and theory of art and thus skilled in the handling and expression of ideas.
		- With unbridled axiological fervor, it wants to establish what art is and, in the very next breath, to stipulate the kind of man and society that wish to produce or consume it.
		- As a result [of artistic intellectualism], artistic activities become intellectual exercises that remain within the bounds of the problems of Western art history and theory—as if Latin American art were simply a lagging sequel to the art produced by advanced countries.
		- the intellectualists would confine themselves to arguments concerning the superstructure and the decline of both high art and objectual art, and simply imitate foreign actions or trends, given that they have no goals of their own and are not seeking sociological, third-world reasons and advantages based on the real fact of decline. For them, the need for a new aesthetic would be intellectual rather than experiential, a question of superficial imitation rather than of existentialism.
		- The goal is not to banish ideas or knowledge. On the contrary we should embrace both, as valuable and indispensable tools for studying the infrastructural, psychosocial, and sensory mutations of our third-world reality, a task that requires us to move more freely beyond the history and theory of art, both of which are generally confined to matters pertaining to the superstructure of art.
	- Subjectualism
		- The reverse is true of our artistic subjectivism, which stifles all intellectual curiosity, leaving art at the mercy of our emotional irrationalism.
		- The alternative at which it arrives is distributionism: to produce high art for the people, or to popularize existing art in its name.
- [...] the only thing that can fulfill this role is a uniquely third-world, sociological perspective. This solution is by no means a new one. It is in the air we breathe, and artists everywhere are practicing it: they begin with sociological material, and the aesthetic result is a by-product. 
- we can no longer entertain the idea of a single, fixed, artistic solution—or continue to hierarchically divide the various expressions of our sensorium. The best solution would therefore be to promote aesthetic pluralism, which simply means to bestow a “legal” personality upon the myriad expressions that are a de facto part of any community, so that they can be mixed without predefined hierarchical criteria.
- [...] we will have to position our aesthetic expressions within the framework of the heterogeneous societies that are subject to constant, radical change at the mental and sensorial levels due to the effects of the technological revolution.
