# Final - Brainstorming

## Q2 - Public Space
The public space has undergone significant transformations, becoming an essential medium for Mexican artists to address and challenge political and social issues. Many movements have used distinct strategies to engage with audiences and the art establishment. Choose at least two of these movements and analyze how they reconfigured public spaces and audiences through their artistic approaches. Discuss how these strategies served as forms of agitation, negotiation, or reflection on historical, social, and political contexts. Illustrate how public space was appropriated and transformed into a site of mediation or contestation. Support your analysis with examples of specific artists and artworks.

### Possible artists
- Treintatreintistas
- Proceso Pentagono
- Grupo SUMA
	- I love the way they print on other materials
	- Especially that IBM punch card
		- Lots of room here for researching the role of computer companies at the time
		- Maybe some kind of reflection with their role today?

## Q3 - Women
Surrealism opened new opportunities for Mexican women artists in a predominantly male art world. These artists not only established their presence in the local artistic scene but also paved the way for the evolution of womenâ€™s artistic expression throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. The contributions of women were pivotal to the development of the avant-garde, feminist groups of the 1980s, and neo-conceptualist art addressing issues such as the war on drugs and the rise of femicides. Choose two specific examples of artists and artworks to discuss how the work of women artists was perceived and how they used their personal experiences to challenge the role of women in Mexican society. Explain how art became a means of political denunciation for gender and social issues.

### Possible artists
- Frida Kahlo
	- Lots of interesting stuff here about how her work has been appropriated by capitalism and liberal feminism in modern day
	- Connection to how her work was appropriated by the surrealists of her time
- Remedios Varo
- Leonora Carrington
- Lorena Wolffer
	- Could contrast with the way that Wolffer is more confrontational
	- From her earlier performance art to her more recent work seemingly focused around slogans, ads in public spaces
- Teresa Margolles <3
	- I want to write about her because I find her subtle way of introducing death and politics to be so fascinating
	- The way she makes the emptiness so felt
	- Not sure that Margolles engages as much with feminism and womanhood as the others
	- She seems more interested in narco deaths in general
	- As these kinds of deaths affect marginalised people more maybe there's something there?
		- The work with the embroidery feels like my best link here

The point *is* to compare

So Teresa Margolles / Lorena Wolffer is def the way to go, locking in!

### more focused:
- Margolles: Utilizes the gallery space in a way that she makes absences felt, palpable, but subtle. The social reality for these women and the absences felt there are brought into relief through haunting, abject, uncanny - again, palpable but subtle
	- absence caused by death
		- deaths, ofc, of marginalized people
		- i.e. poor people, *women*
	- also absences caused by the erasure of marginalized realities
		- ex. night club floors
		- women, trans, sex workers
	- **absence** of the marginalized
		- absence is important because it is key to this subtlety
		- it's more than possible for someone to experience on eof her works and not realize what it means (utilizing conceptualism's flexibility and vagueness)
		- nevertheless, there is something wrong with her work, it feels like there's nothing there, or at least that there should be more
		- representing how so many people live in a state of willing ignorance
		- ie this absence is felt
		- hopefully, driving one to investigate, and then to learn the truth that they have been suffused with this absence, with death
	- possible theories to connect to
		- globalization
		- no-objetualismo
		- necropolitics
		- gore capitalism
		- abject
		- hauntology???
			- Doesn't quite directly apply in either the Derrida or the Fisher sense
			- Both have to do with haunting, erasure of barriers, traces
			- but, the time scale is different, more human than societal
			- also the loss is more direct: death, real ghosts, not just economic condition
			- also, added spatial or class structure breaking
				- the audience is not those who have lost
				- rather it's those far away who ignore and benefit off that loss
			- that being said, there is a similar examination of the failures of neoliberalism and capitalism, much in the same way as Fisher, the failure to manifest of a peaceful future free of drug violence????
			- ---
			- There's also a section on ethnography that seems promising on Wikipedia
			- Seems to be about places where life and people used to be but have been abandoned
			- Similar to Juarez, which used to thrive but is a shell of its former self
			- ---
			- all of this goes back to women because as a further marginalized, group within the working class, they are particularly affected
- Wolffer: I think I wanna contrast her by talking about how visceral and confrontational Wolffer is, all while touching on similar themes
	- Could also connect to hauntings? traces? The marks on her body, the phrases and words sourced from women

Pregunta para Nuria: quiero conectar el trabajo de Margolles a una historia mas amplia, en donde puedo buscar (articulo de The Guardian habla de como Juarez solia ser un vacation city para gente famosa americana)

At the end of the day, I might not need this much of a historical background

She often mixes elements form Mexico with those of the places she visits
