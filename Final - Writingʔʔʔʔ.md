# Final - Writing????

Working on essays (including this one) has historically not been an easy task for me. The one-two punch of self-confidence issues and OCD deludes my brain into thinking that my writing should simply spring forth from my brain, fully formed. Anything less feels unacceptable and can easily lead me into a spiral of writer's block, anxiety, and negative self-talk. In this way I relate strongly to the eponymous first of two protagonists from Remedy Entertainment's survival horror video game *Alan Wake II (AWII)*. Alan is a tortured writer haunted by anger, writer's block, and a negative self-image. Utilizing close reading techniques and performance theory, I will analyze how the game depicts his struggle to overcome these issues, invoking ritual imagery in order to illuminate the process of personal growth. The comparison brings to light how the authority and constructed nature of rituals mirror similar qualities in self-image, as well as how these can be utilized to make positive changes in one's own life.

To begin, I will demonstrate how Alan's journey throughout *AWII* is comparable to rituals, using both comparisons the game itself makes and the definition of ritual according to performance theorist Richard Schechner. At the start of *AWII*, Alan has spent over a decade attempting to escape from a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place. As a malleable place that follows dream-logic, it changes shape according to Alan's psyche, but it can also be consciously controlled via art, which is granted reality-altering power by the Dark Place. His escape attempts consist of writing two novels that make up the game's events. The first one I'll be focusing on is entitled "Initiation" and makes up his portion of the game as tries to learn about the Dark Place enough to escape. These novels that reshape reality is where we see the first connection to performance theory. According to Schechner, the main feature of ritual that differentiates it from other kinds of performance is that they are enacted for the purpose of effecting change (*An Introduction* 159). In the real world, writing would be placed under a different category of performance, but in *AWII* it very literally does alter the world and the various characters within

The game itself also directly makes the comparison between his writing and rituals. "Initiation" is split into three distinct loops, three different stories Alan writes about himself navigating a new location in the Dark Place. In each one, Alan searches for plot beats and scenes necessary in order to write into existence gruesome ritual murders. At each of these, the phrase "This is the ritual to lead you on" can be found scrawled on walls and spoken by cultists. While in the story Alan writes, it refers to the cult's attempts to summon an entity named Mr. Scratch through the rituals, it rapidly becomes clear that it also refers to Alan's process of writing in and of itself. Each time he recreates one of these murder scenes, the Dark Place's geography changes in order to allow him to physically progress, literally leading him on. In a less literal reading though, these are also helping him along his character arc, leading him towards a transformation. After the first such murder ritual is encountered in the game, Alan's detective character, Alex Casey, says "Something had soaked into this place at a molecular level. [...] Marking you. Taking you for a ride" ("Initiation 2: Casey").

While the game is vague with regards to how exactly Alan's writing ritual helps him along his journey of self-improvement, we can turn to Victor Turner's conception of liminality and liminal rituals for help finalizing this connection. The liminal refers to the in-between. In turn, a liminal ritual is a ritual which seeks to effect a transformation in its practitioner by extending the spacetime in-between states (Schechner, *An Introduction* 144). The liminal is omnipresent in the "Initiation" portion of *AWII*. From the talk show Alan begins each loops on, called 'In-Between With Mr. Door,' to the impermanent deaths that bookend many of his loops, to the place he is trapped in explicitly being named the "Dark" Place, Alan is drowning in the liminal. *AWII*'s fixation on these liminal symbols of death and darkness is particularly relevant because according to Schechner these are particularly important parts of a liminal ritual. In these rituals, "persons temporarily become 'nothing.'" so that they may then be "inscribed with their new identities" (Schechner, *An Introduction* 145). Alan writing about murder rituals thus help bring him closer to this liminal state. Furthermore, all his loops, his rituals, including the game as a whole, end with his own death or possession by the Dark Place ("Initiation 3: Haunted"; Initiation 6: Return; "Initiation 9: Gone"; "Return 9: Come Home"). Alan's writing process functions as a liminal ritual, plunging him into the darkness and leading him on towards transformation.

Now, what does this connection between ritual, and self-improvement say about this latter process? The first of two elements of ritual I wish to explore is the authority of ritual, and how this is represented within the game. All types of performance feature a set of rules that governs how one enacts the performance, but the source of said rules separates ritual from other types of performance. For these other types of performance, the rules come either from within, or from others around the performer, such as their society or community. For ritual, however, these rules may be transmitted by other people, but they come instead from a higher authority (Schechner, *Theory* 17). Throughout *AWII*, Alan makes repeated appeals to similar authorities: those of genre conventions and art in general. One very obvious example is that of the monomyth. The two books he writes that make up the game's events are even named "Initiation" and "Return", the latter two stages of the monomyth (the book that makes up the first game's events is named "Departure", after the first stage). He also frequently talks about how he can't just "make something out of nothing" and that the writing needs to "[ring] true" in order for it to successfully affect reality ("Return 4: No Chance"; "Initiation 2: Casey"). As a result, when he finds that the manuscript for "Return", the second novel that makes up the second protagonist's story and Alan's escape, has already been written as a horror story, he concludes that he is unable to change the genre ("Initiation 6: Return"). In so doing, he limits the role he and the other characters can play, stating in the game's opening monologue that "In a horror story, there are only victims and monsters" ("Prologue: The Cult").

Alan thus writes himself into his own story as both the victim and the monster. Throughout most of the game, Alan believes he is being hunted by Mr. Scratch, an evil double of himself created by the Dark Place, attributing many of his misfortunes to Scratch. This includes the writing of the initial horrific draft of "Return" and his wife, Alice, being haunted and terrorized ("Initiation 6: Return", "Initiation 3: Haunted"). Near the end of the game, Alan even comes to believe that Alice's haunting led her to commit suicide. This causes Alan to murder himself in an earlier loop when he storms into his writer's room and finds himself editing "Return," believing, in his rage, that it is Scratch instead. Struck by hopelessness, realizing all too late that Scratch has been himself all along, he gives in to the Dark Place, allowing himself to become possessed and turning into the real Mr. Scratch: a personification of his own anger, self-obsession and ego ("Initiation 9: Gone"). 

Returning to ritual, this authority that Alan grants to his conception of genre conventions, and thus the liminal ritual he practices, reminds me of the authority that self-image can have over a person. It's easy, when one acts out of anger, selfishness, or any such emotion, to take such an action as proof that one is inherently a bad person.  This belief, in turn, begets further hurtful behaviour, as one begins to abdicate responsibility for one's actions because it's simply the way one is, the way one is supposed to be. I myself have been down this road in the past. It happened while writing this essay. I became scared that I couldn't write it and I began to spiral, believing I couldn't write it and thus avoiding it. Such a strict idea of what one's role is, this belief, begins to crystallize and make itself reality, much in the same way that Alan writes himself into and keeps himself within the roles of victim and monster. Or, the way in which a liminal ritual inscribes a new identity in someone. Writing about the belief one has in the everyday performance of their own roles, Schechner quotes Nietzsche as saying "If someone obstinately and for a long time wants to appear something it is in the end hard for him to be anything else" (*An Introduction* 116).

So. Where does someone like Alan go from there? The second element of rituals that I wish to explore is that they are ultimately constructions. Despite this authority, this air of history and immutability, rituals are designed by people and can change based on the needs of their practitioners (Schechner, *An Introduction* 160). A crucial part of Alan's journey throughout the game is learning precisely this lesson, that the rules he follows, the roles he plays are self-imposed and that he can break with them. Indeed, a character near the end of the game directly refers to "these convoluted loops [he insists] on going through" ("Initiation 7: Masks"). 

Probably the most important rule he breaks with in writing Return is that of the single protagonist, central to the monomyth structure I mentioned earlier. Indeed, this aspect of the monomyth has come under quite a bit of criticism recently due to its implication of a very individualistic world view (Bond). Alan comes to realize that he can't solve his problems entirely on his own, that he needs the help of others and writes Saga Anderson, *AWII*'s second and equal protagonist, into the story (specifically the "Return" sections). Throughout the game, she works to help Alan escape from the outside, drawn into the story when she comes to investigate murder rituals that mirror those Alan explores in the Dark Place. Importantly though, she is not a mere supporting character. Saga has her own journey all about learning to have confidence in herself and refusing roles or stories others wish to put her in, such as Alan. As a result of Alan's insistence on horror stories only having victims and monsters, he changes Saga's backstory for her daughter to have died years before the events of the story. ("Return 5: Old Gods"). Despite moments of self-doubt, and with some help from her grandfather, she denies this false reality and asserts herself at the story's end, co-writing the ending with Alan. It's only with her perspective that Alan realizes the possibility for heroes in the story ("Return 9: Come Home").

Returning one last time to performance theory, This need for Alan to have perspectives external to himself connects to Bertolt Brecht's style of theatre, and then back to the liminal. Brecht believed that an actor should not disappear into their role, but rather distance themself from their character, thus allowing a more critical relationship with it (Schechner, *An Introduction* 86). Alan learning to receive input from other people, as well as being immersed in the liminality of the Dark Place, literally observing his actions from outside himself, functions similarly. With this external perspective, one is better able to understand himself, his shadow, and how to integrate it into a more healthy version of himself. Even the player of Alan Wake II is placed in an external perspective, a position where they are better able to be critical of Alan, and perhaps themself. Despite otherwise being a relatively standard video game with a computer-rendered 3D environment, various pivotal scenes in the game are instead presented in live action footage. This reminds the player of the constructed nature of the game, distancing them from the game's events, to an extent.
