# Final - Writing????

Working on essays (including this one) has historically not been an easy task for me. The one-two punch of self-confidence issues and OCD deludes my brain into thinking that my writing should simply spring forth from my brain, fully formed. Anything less feels unacceptable and can easily lead me into a spiral of writer's block, anxiety, and negative self-talk. In this way I relate strongly to the namesake of Remedy Entertainment's 2023 survival horror video game *Alan Wake II*, a tortured writer who similarly has issues with writer's block and a very negative self-image. The game depicts his struggle to overcome these issues, invoking ritual imagery in order to illuminate the process of personal growth. Utilizing close reading techniques and performance theory, I will explore how this comparison emphasizes how the authority and constructed nature of rituals mirror similar qualities in self-image and how these can be utilized to make positive changes in one's own life.

To start off, I will provide a short description of *Alan Wake II*'s plot. The game focuses on dual protagonists, the first being Alan himself. He is a novelist who has been trapped in a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place for over a decade. The Dark Place pulls from Alan's psyche, his memories and insecurities. As an example, in one area of the game fashioned after the New York subway, all the signage is replaced with dialogue of Alan's from various games, as well as discouraging messages encouraging him to give up that read like negative self-talk ("Initiation 2: Casey"). The Dark Place doesn't simply pull from Alan's subconscious, however, its power can be harnessed through creative works of art, causing them to become reality, not just in the Dark Place, but in the real world outside as well. Thus, throughout the game, Alan writes stories that become the events of the game in order to navigate the Dark Place and ultimately escape. Unfortunately for Alan and those he includes in his writing, the Dark Place also affects the stories, turning them into horror stories. The game's second protagonist is Saga Anderson, an FBI detective pulled into Alan's horror story when she bewgins to investigate ritualistic murders around Caldera Lake, a lake that functions as the threshold between the Dark Place and reality. She acts as a foil to Alan,
