# Week 1 - IXD: Interaction Design

### Definitions

- Tackara, 2001, why as well as how of daily **interactions** using computers
- Preece, rogers, Sharp, 2011, designing interactive products, **support communication** and interaction in everyday and work
- Siang, 2020, design of interaction b/ users and products, goal is to create **products**

### Implications
- A larger focus on products over time
- "user"
	- Control, power
	- Is "using" the only way we interact? what about play? experience?
		- Need for connection?
	- Need for a purpose, work
	- One pro is that humans are not the only entities interacting w/ computers

### Who is using it?
Things for work seem to have a little less care, more bare-bones, more information density

Ex. Shaadi - marriage service
Lots of parents using it
Entirely different set of priorities

### Boundaries and overlaps
Began with Human-Computer Interaction, computer science + psychology

Involves visual design, industrial design, sound design, human architecture, information architecture

It's **not** software engineering
SE is really focused on the software
IXD more about the relationship

### UX
Used more interchangeably
Focus more on experience, not things
Techno-centric vs. human centric

#### Variations
- UX popularised after IxD
- HCI more academic, IxD and UX more industry
- HCI -> IxD -> UX -> product design -> service design
- (UCD & HCD? for later)
- can't *design* an experience, can design *for* an experience
	- Designing opportunities for experience
	- Affordance
	- Designer not only end of equation, person has to engage in a certain way

#### Sidebar about everything apps
Frustration with services that try to be everything
Services end up fighting what users want to do on the platform
Result of capitalist need for growth, capturing *users*
Tumblr interesting example where devs are not generally able to impose significant changes on its user base

## Interaction

### Usability
Very iutilitarian, work focused
Usability can be thought of as a circle within IxD
What about fun? Enjoyment? 

### Flavours of interactivity
**Communication**: 
relationship between two or more people
contextually, mutually adapting behaviour and actions
not just talking!

**Media Studies**
Processes taking place b/ receivers and media messages
How audience experiences message, personal, b/ designer(s) and audience

**Human-Computer Interaction**
Process that takes place when a human user operates a machine

LLM ex.
Communication?
Back and forth between person and model, figuring out the limits and desires/tendencies of either, adapting prompts and responses accordingly
Media Studies?
How do people interpret what LLMs give them? How is it presented?
HCI?
How do people work to *use* the tech? Prompt Engineering

### Crampton Smith - Dimesnsions of Interaction
equivalent of early stages of cinema
Should communicate info, but not overwhelm

**1D**: Words
meaningful, simple to understand
communicate info, not overwhelm
ok vs sure, that's possible

**2D**: Visual representations
Imagery, typography, icons
Supplement words

**3D**: Physical Objects / Space
What physical objects do users interact with?
What physical space do they interact in?
Implied embodied action?

**4D**: Time
Media that changes over time (animation, video, sound)
Time spent in interaction

**5D**: Behaviour
How do users perform actions?
How do they operate the product?
What is the reaction?

## Design

### Def.
To devise coourses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones - Herbert Simon

Preferred situations are contextual

### Art vs design
Design is always **for** something
Art is more freeform, no **use**

Does design have more of a lifespan?
If people decide they want a different interaction and it's better, designers might change direction for that
Whereas in art maybe there's less of a need to direct the experience and different unexpected responses are more encouraged

**Design solves problems
Art poses problems**

## IXD Process
1. Establish requirements
2. Designing alternatives
3. Prototyping
4. Evaluation

How process feels
**Scribbly** vibes
It's not a loop or a line, it's a spiral!

### Unfolding
Map the problem space!
What are the requirements / criteria / goals / objectives

### Double Diamond model
Problem space - solution space
Patterns of divergence (expanding, discovering) & convergence
