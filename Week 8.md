# Week 8

### Match between system and real world
The design should speak user's language
Use words, phrases, concepts familiar to user, not internal jargon
Follow real-world conventions, info appears in a natural and logical order

makeup UI that has you pick between 3 skin tones, then expands with similar ones from your choise a few times

### User control and freedom
Users often perform actions by mistake, they need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave current action
Not an extended process

### Recognition rather than recall
Minimize the user's memory load
Make elements, actions, options visible
User shouldn't have to remember where something is

Ex. Putting different options in a giant list

## Nielsen's Usability Heuristics for ui design
Don't use these to determine design, run through them afterwards

## Tog's principles of interaction design
These are great for the actual design process!

## Dark patterns

### Ex. Shein
So much fomo
percent off, percent sold, bar, (so many) coupons, seconds countdown timer, "collect all"

### Confirmshaming
Using language and emotion (shame) to steer users away from a certain choice

### Scarcity
Indicating to users that something is rare, which makes users want more

### Activity messages
Informing user about activity on the website
ex. views, visits, etc.
Can make people think an item is popular and thus want it for fear of runnign out

### Forced action
Forcing user to do something they were not intending to do in order to complete their task
Ex. poll that only allows "excellent" and "unsure" as options

### Confirmshaming / Pressured selling


# Max Keleher - CHORUS lab, 
Deceptive vs dark patterns
more descriptive term,
less politcal baggage

## Persuasive deisgn
late 90's research
captology:
computers as persuasive technologies
Can be positive or negative!

## Pattern
reused solution to common problem
child cave: a space for children where they are able to be the only ones there
A problem an adult might not be aware of
Why are the companies utilising these deceptive patterns?

## Deceptive design
**tricks** used in websites and apps

## How well do experts understand end-user experience

RQ1: How do end-users perceive deceptive patterns
RQ2: How well do experts understand end-users perceptions of deceptive patterns

### Methodology
16 images, from most explicit (most deceptive) to implicit to not established
Explicit images came from research papers

People: end-users, Canadians over 18
imagine you are in the middle of reading an rticle

Experts: international, authors of papers about deceptive patterns or knowledgeable about topic
Imagine an end user was in the middle of reading an article when image shows up

Compare experts' estimations vs end-users

Options on description
utility, cluttered vs minimal, privacy respected?, common, annoying, honest, ethical, thoughtless

### Results
Honest to deceitful
For explicit and implicit images, end users believed they were much more honest than the experts thought they would be
Respectful of privacy or intrusive
for explicit and implicit images, end users and experts were on par
But for not established, experts' estimated they would be thought of as more intrusive than they were

### Other experiment
Showing images and simply classing things as yes or no
Experts answering as self

#### Results
For explicit, they were similar
For implicit, experts thought they were more deceptive than end-users
Big difference for fake scarcity 

Key insights
End users struggle to identify subtle aptterns
may lack understandign of underlying things
Experts overestimate perception of these patterns

## Other paper
