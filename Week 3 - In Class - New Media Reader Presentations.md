## Constituents of a Theory of the Media

mobilizing power
able to influence and mobilize
shape public opinion

orwellian fantasy
single entity in control unlikely, possible
media can control and manipulate, however

Cultural archaism
left wing view media as threat to traditional culture & society
complex evolving system to be understood

democratic manipulation
media *is* manipulation

means of consumption and production

written literature outdated

desacrilization of art
aart no longer seen as sacred or transcendental
now part of everyday life

## Requiem for the Media

Baudrillard

social relation

existing order reduces media to medium of distribution

everyone can be an emitter
revolutionaries must use this to their advantage
open communication
unlimited democratic something
mass participation in social process

critique
no social relations or potential as long as it remains
monolog
even if everyone becomes transmitter, as long as still within mass media system, no big change is created

unilateral channels allow for no response
era non-response, irresponsibility

hypocrisy ofo electoral system
people's power contained within power of larger system
reader left with only choice to accept or deny media

revolution of '68
media believed to have a role
flattening signs and their meaning into representation
people listening just that, listening

simulacra and simulation
persuasive effects on modern society of simulacra
online persona
movies

real revolutionary media
walls, speech, silk-screen posters

structure of dialectic should be reformed
breach fundamental role of non-response enunciated by media

## tech & society

chicken or egg?

technological determinism
new tech is created
which leads to
social progress

TV
nobody expected it to be sucha big part of society

symptomatic technology
society and its problems exist first
tech is thus created in response
does not mean if problem exists, tech solution will be found
probability is higher but not necessary
those with power to decide 

military tech
created at very fast rate due to demand

industrial production
capitalists focus on efficiency of manufacturing

capitalism restrains development?
modern take could involve cellphones and social media and its impacts

take that if TV had not been invented,
something else would be created in its place
what is thot of as effects of tech
could be seen as effect of vast amalgamation of different factors

Abigail's opinion <3
more on side of symptomatic

Fred's opinion <3
more on side of determinism
doesn't think we're attuned to it

both positions are viable
discourse network
weather front at friction between ideologies

seeking to abolish separation between actors and audience

simultaneous dramaturgy

theater as discourse
using real life situations in performance
making understanding easier for audience
drawing on easier to understand situations

too anxious about if I would go or not

## Put-That-There: Voice and Gesture at the Graphics Interface

searching for the simplest way for users to interface via natural language
Description of a system
media room
directly manipulating visual objects on a compputer screen
elements
- chair from which to control system
- virtual graphical display
- speech recognition microphone
- computer vision module
  - space sensing cubes 
  - 1 transmitter & 1 sensor
  - point to screen

when microphone and cubes are active,
one can alter interface
possible: create a blue square there
better: put that there
pointing to the spots
use of pronouns
one could move circle without even needing to know it's a circle
just with "that"

Xbox Kinect, Wiimote
