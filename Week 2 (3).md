# Week 2

## Ohm's Law
At a constant temperature, the electrical current flowing through a fixed linear resistance is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and also inversely proportional to the resistance.

Must flow from high potential to low potential
If the potential is the same from one end to the other, there is no flow
static electricity???

		V = I * R
		I = V / R
		R = V / I

Power is defined as the rate at which energy is transferred
It's measured by combining both how much voltage is transferred, and how fast that transfer (current) happens

		P = V * I 

Each component in a circuit either produces or consumes

Wattage is a measure of energy over a set amount of time

		W = J / S

Heat is energy, temperature is average recording in that moment/place

A circuit is a path that starts and stops at the same place, the circular path is always required for electricity to flow

**Issues and bad ideas**
- Most likely issue, incomplete circuit
- Don't introduce power to a circuit in progress
- Never connect a battery to itself with no resistance
	- causes infinite current

A node is an electrical junction between two or more components
Two components are in series if they share a common node and if the same current flows through them
If components share two common nodes, they are in parallel

Resistors (current limiting device) do two things
- They limit the current!
- They also impede the flow of, siphon off, voltage
	- This voltage is transformed into heat

In series
R = R1 + R2 + ...

In parallel
1 / R = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / ...
R = Value of resistors / Num. of resistors
If all resistors are the same

Capacitors are the opposite of resistors
In series, it's the ratio
In parallel, it's the sum

Batteries
Some rechargeable batteries have different voltages than the form factor

Diodes only allow current in one direction
Cathode = negative terminal
Anode = positive terminal
Irl diodes have bars printed on them to demarcate the cathode

LED (light emitting diode)
(Why are LEDs diodes?)
The anode is the longer end
The anode also has a little lip
If u can see into the body of the LED, The smaller of the two components is the anode

Integrated circuits Have various pins
THere's usually a notch and a dot to demarcate the first pin
The pins are counted by rotating counter-clockwise


Electrolytic capacitors
Can be thought of as small batteries???
Have long leads, areas to demarcate

Using a multimeter

Set dial to music note w/ diode

Touch leads to a thing!
It'll tell you the resistance
Can also tell you ex. the sides of an led, by testing which direction allows for current

Above that, can check resistance according to numbers
Put multimeter higher than what you think it is
If you set it below the resistance, it'll tell u 0

hfe can be skipped

V with a horizontal bar and three dots
(direct current)

V with tilde
(Alternating current)

Centigrade
Connect thermocouples
Check temperature!

20k and F can be skipped

A~ is alternating current again
