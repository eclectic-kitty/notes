# Content
Technically in mechanics section

Many types of content

## Choose your own adventure book example
Samurai book
First choice: forest of shadows direction
Burning village: we choose to investigate
Horde of bandits, samurai
Something about someone going rogue, Lord something
We fight samurai, should have rolled a die but Jonathan had us win automatically
We choose to sneak around and pick people off
First big choice: sparing an enemy samurai or not, then taking him with us or not

All content, minimal other mechanics
## Fiction
All games have a fictional component,
There has to be a reason for the rules to matter

Chess -> Medieval battle

- Half-Real, Jesper Juul
To play a video game is therefore to interact with real rules while imagining a fictional world

### Why game fiction?
- **Metaphors** for making sense of rules
- Fuel for imaginary immersion
- : Adds **qualitative** value

### Fiction as metaphor for rules
Rules of ten hard to learn or remember,
but when they are tied to a narrative situation, they become easier to remember
*dressing up* the situation

EX. Space Invaders
Little weird guys, moving towards you
Phallic symbol, shooting thing
Ok, aliens are invading and I have to shoot and kill them

**Aside**: Arcade games are great for examples of self-explanatory simple design\

Sometimes these stories can be a stretch, don't help explain, but they can be nice to experience

### Fiction for imaginative immersion
Can make the game elements more interesting

Ex. Rogue
Instead of a boring map and units of x, y, z
You're an adventurer! Finding potions and treasure!!!

## Narrative
Fiction doesn't inherently involve a story, it can just be a setting

Games can **embed narrative** through:
- Text
- Cutscenes
- Audio
- Environmental storytelling
- Etc.

Why **embed narrative**?
- Leverage imaginative immersion and curiosity,
give a reason to care
- Motivate longer-term engagement,
wanting to know what happens!
- Dress up a tree structure

Using games for narrative is relatively new:
Traditional games had fiction but not (embedded) narratives
Although riddles and children's games serve as few counter-examples

## Emergence & Progression structures
**Emergence**
Primordial game structure
Specified as a small number of rules, combine and yield large numbers of variations
player must design strategies to handle situations
Ex. card, board, sports, action & strategy

**Progression**
Historically newer
Became part of the video game through **adventure genre**
Player has to perform a predefined set of actions in order to complete
One feature: yields strong control to game designer
Designer controls sequence of events
Where we find most games with storytelling ambitions

Test:
Can it be beat with a walkthrough? Progression
Do you need a strategy guide? Emergence

Ex.
Choose your own adventure books: progression, have to go somewhere , do that
Starcraft: Emergent in moment to moment, but cutscenes in between are progression
DnD: Could be seen as both, not necessarily a spectrum or dichotomy, elements that can co-habit

### vs
- Not a **dichotomy**
- Most modern digital games have elements of both
Progression can be not just story, but levels technology trees, etc.

## Game worlds
Games can model space and create visitable **worlds**
In film, novels, you see things, but you don't feel like you're there
Games allow you to visit, explore

Monopoly board / city also counts! 
Abstract but it's there
Also text-based, exists in your mind as you interact

## Visuals and audio
- Aesthetic pleasure (**sensory immersion**)
- Helps establish **fiction** and **narratives**
Sometimes visuals or audio are enough!
One can totally play through a game to just experience vibe, aesthetic, or the fiction/narrative if game is less interesting

## Puzzles
Can be embedded in games
Form of progression scheme
Change of pace, breather
Can be distracting if entirely disconnected from fiction or rest of game

## Equipment/Tools
Physical equipment needed for game
controllers, dice, racket, go-kart, computer, etc.
Part of the rules! Can only play with this

## The more a game relies on content...
- The more work for designer
- The less replayability

Also,
- Content is often more important to new players
- Experienced players will "see through it"
- This isn't a or b though, it's a trajectory
