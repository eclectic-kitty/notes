# Sensory Immersion

audiovisually impressive, 3d, stereophonic audio, etc.
Is it really immersive?
Not sure, but it certainly does something

VR
Definitely the most sensory immersive anything gets
You have presence

Actually being there
LARPing
Escape rooms

## Game feel
Steve Swink Def
Real time control of virtual objects in a virtual space, with interactions emphasized by polish
Venn diagram between:
- Spatial sim.
- Polish
- real-time control
Blend of different experiences, being immersed and feeling the game

5 most common experiences:
- aesthetic sensation of control
- Pleasure of learning, practicing and mastering a skill
- Extension of the senses
- Extension of identity
- Interactino with a unique physical reality within game

## Ilinx
Pursuit of vertrigo, voluptuous panic upon a lucid mind,
surrendering to a spasm, shock that destroys reality

Humans have an inherent desire for extreme sensations
swinging, throwing babies in the air
bungee jumping, rollercoasters
playful sensations too
playdoh, bubble poppers, fidget spinners

Not just immersive, playful sensations are part of other games
RPGs: rolling dice
Holding dice
Slot machines (nothing happens, but it's stimulating! All polish!)
