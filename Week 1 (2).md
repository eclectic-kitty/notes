# Week 1

# Intro

## Frida Kahlo - Las dos Fridas (1939)
Two Fridas, one dressed in higher-class clothes, The other dressed more simply

Painted after divorce from Diego Rivera
One holding a bleeding blood vessel and scissors, one holding a portrait of Diego
One more European, one mestiza
Struggled with medical issues throughout her life
Bisexual (in a v macho society)

One of the most famous Mexican painting
Marks end of Muralism
Move from grand nationalist statements to inward-looking work

*Gloria Anzaldua*
*Borderline / la Frontera*

## Modern art & Contemporary art
Modern art: 20th century up until 1960s/70s
Contemporary art: 1960s/70s to today

Epistemological shift

How is the art canon framed vs art from the global south?

### Post-revolutionary and Contemporary art:

Two important events:
#### Mexican revolution 1910's to 20's
Originated Mexican state-sponsored art
ex. movements: muralists, but certainly others

#### Movimiento ciudadano del '68
Massacre de Tlatelolco
A lot of experimentation

## Geography
Mexico is part of North America geographically,
But culturally, Latin America

### Latin America
Group of territories and countries in the Americas where Romance langages are spoken
Defined by colonialism
Colonized by Spain and Portugal
As such, somewhat controversial
But nevertheless, an important marker of identity

### Abya Yala
Intimate and indissoluble relation between the body and the land
Departs from binary Western colonial systems of thoughts

Mexico has the largest Spanish-speaking population of any country in the world
But,
It has 68 living Indigenous language
Ex. Nahuatl, Zaopteco, Mixteco, etc.
As well as immigrants and im.-descended people

# Posada, Dia de los Muertos, catrinas

## Intro: Spectre opening
Despite being filmed in Mexico City, completely invented parade and people dressing up as catrinas
Also fucking yellow filter I'm going to murder someone I swear to fu-

## Posada - La Calavera Catrina (1910-1913)
Etching of skeleton in a v elegant hat
Has become image of Mexican identity, but originally,
a satirical portrait of people who rejected mestizo origins, who pursued aristocratic ideals in pre-revolutionary times
Hat is related to European styles rather than latin-american
feathers (ostrich) and other bird parts were a symbol of class 
Grabancera: (Chickpea) word to refer to people such as this

## Dia de los muertos
Ofrendas, comida y bebidas, calaveras de azucar, mariachis, visitar las tumbas
Syncratic tradition of pre-Columbian and Catholic origins
in pre-colonial times, dead loved ones were buried beside the home
Kept close to the living
Also comes from all-saints day

## Jose Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913)
Important political cartoonist in representing the lower classes

De Aguascalientes (en el norte)
His career began as a political cartoonist for a newspaper in Aguascalientes, El Jicote
Moved to Mexico City to work for a revolutionary newspaper
Opened a print shop there
Printed many different calaveras, not just Catrina
Printing plates for his calaveras came with text as well
Calaveras were created for dia de los muertos**(?)**

Political cartoons, developed in England at begininning of 18th century, very important & developed at this point in time, esp. in the Northern hemisphere
Could be understood without needing to read
Mexican population at the time was very illiterate

### Posada and his calaveras
Would depict anyone as calaveras 
Ex. people dancing el Jarabe, Colera, Arrival of the electric trams in DF, streetcleaners, WW1, etc.
Would depict both important high-class people, and the life of lower-class people
Would satires for political critique and revolutionary purposes
(Ex. made calaveras of Porfirio Diaz, Zapata, Adelitas (mujeres que lucharon en la revolucion))

### Impact
Despite the endurance of his calaveras, Posada died in poverty
Important figure in folk art, rejecting the Western canon
Helped to inspire los muralistas
Diego Rivera very inspired by Posada
At Academia de San Carlos (museo hoy en dia), he would visit Posada's studio as it was 1 block from the academy
In his last painting, Sueno de una tarde dominical en la Alameda Central, he included himself as a 10 year old boy holding a catrina's hand
His etchings were at first somewhat forgotten but collected by French artist, Jean Charlot, connected to Rivera
Now this collection lives in the library of the University of Hawaii

For Posada, the catrina was a symbol of legacy, colonialism, and a rejection of indigeneity during the Porifiriato
Today, it is a nationalist symbol and to a certain extent (ironically), a symbol often appropriated by European-descended people to represent Mexico
Interesting to me that catrinas these days are often portrayed with flowers instead of feathers
