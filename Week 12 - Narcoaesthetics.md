# Week 12 - Narcoaesthetics

## Readings

Zones de Tolérance
Printed by Parachute, leading art magazine in mtl in the 2000's
created issues centered on art from latin america, early here
One of the first articles to expose rest of world to this movement

## Francis Älys - Reenactments (2001)
Artist bought gun, walked around, got arrested, filmed
Then again, with cooperation of the police

What's real or not?
How does filming obscure reality?
How does the media create fiction?
Critiquing police, by paying them to engage in the reenactment, not face legal consequences

Before 911, exarcebation of policing since then

## Drug market
Globalisation has greatly grown demand
Also raises violence on a local level between cartels

How can art address these realities? This violence?
How does one position themself with regards to the simplified portrayal of these issues in mass media?
To the spectacle made out of it in even news media?
How do we address without merely reproducing these images of violence

### Background
coca, marijuana,
traditional use by indigenous communities throughout south america
60's 70's led to a rise in demand for psychoactive drugs
US enforced(word?) heavy policing and criminalisation of the production of these
Led to the creation of clandestine organisations, cartels
battled cartels (and left-wing guerilla groups) in Colombia
Drug war was somewhat effective in Colombia (hmm)
Evo Morales, Bolivian president, proposed alternative to drug war policies

Mexican cartels' influence rose sharply in the 90's after Colombian cartels
neoliberal policies in Mexico led to people either try to emigrate to US, or join cartels
Felipe Calderon implemented heavy drug war policies in 2006 (until 2012) (limpiemos Mexico)
Militarized the country, sent army into every day life
Arrest of some cartel leaders led cartels to diversify and trade more than simply drugs
ex. stealing petrol and selling it to the States
Violence in public state
Cartels would not only kidnap people, but even display dead bodies in public space (more in the north, as well as Veracruz)
60,000 deaths related to cartels between 2006-2012, 95% not persecuted
900,000 disappeared

### Necropolitics
WHen state and narco dealers are involved in a political struggle for control over dwad
Who has poweer to dictate citizens' circumstances?
walking dead, subjugation of bodies to states between life and death
use of politics to influence or sponsor the illegal drug trade?

which images have an impact here?

## Teresa Margolles (1963)

### In the Air (2003)
Juxtaposition between whimsy of bubbles and very stark white cube
Entering into room, only bubbles cascading over room
If one read the plaques,
The water used for bubbles was recovered from Mexico City morgue to clean unclaimed bodies

First exhibited in Mexico City contemporary art museum
Reproduced in a few places
ex. in Montreal MAC (2017), carpet in center of room where bubbles fell
Allowed people to walk around periphery and avoid bubbles


Passage from presence to absence
Researched social causes and consequences of deaths
Servicio medico forense - semefo
collective she began in
Used human body parts, fluids, items from crime scenes in sculptures, murals, etc.
What are the ethics of her utilizing these materials without permission from these dead people?
Claims to use only those killed via violent causes that go unclaimed, unidentified
Trying to dignify, give voice to these invisible people
Confronting public with the political situation, marginalization of poor people
mortuary monument
Each death leaves a vacuum, an empty, a space
Believes her and her feelings is not important

Vaporization (2001)
Entering room full of steam, not able to see, same water from morgue
More extreme than bubbles
You inhale the liquid

Table and two benches (2005)
same water used to mix cement

Venice Biennale (2009)
Teresa Margolles chosen to represent Mexico
anti-diplomatic choice...
*What else could we talk about?*
shift of focus from morgue to streets, crime scenes
Used sheets used to clean blood at crime scenes
tapestries on walls, embroidered
family members embroider messages to their murdered loved ones
used to create flags, standing in for / representing the Mexican flag
Mopping the floor with water from the morgue (bloody? I remember it being sticky)
Those mopping are people from Sinaloa, Juarez, family members of victims

Score Settling (2008)
Creating jewelry from broken glass left from cars at crime scenes
Engaging with images of wealth valued by narcos

When inundated with these images,
desensitized to these images, to violence
How do you create in this environment?
Choosing to focus on experiential work, completely sidestepping the images themselves
Also a strong sense of absence in her work
A lot of (seemingly) empty rooms, bare sculptures, etc.

### Narcoculture
Aesthetics, culture, religion, etc. unique to narco culture
Jesús Malverde
narco-saint
robin hood type figure for narcos

## Others

### Rosa María Robles
From same city as Margolles

Navajas (2007)
using a style of blanket used by cartels to transport bodies
stained with blood from crime scenes by using a knife
Using criminal evidence led to police ordering blankets removed
re-exhibited by using her own blood

Angel de Independencia (2010)
Recreating statue in Mexico City, commeorating country's freedom
Holding coke package, gun, ostrich feathers as wings, wrapped ina similar quilt

### Sayak Valencia - Gore capitalism
Born in Tijuana

violence, tortured, mutilated bodies -> commodity under capitalism
age of impunity and governmental austerity

cartels use media to publicize and advertise their crimes
media spreads images unquestioningly
media provides publicity, legitimacy

### Lorena Wolffer (1971) - feminicidios

Mientras dormíamos: el caso Juarez (2002 - 2004)
laid on a table and drew outlines on her body
Seems like stab and gunshot wounds
markings almost look surgical

used 50 documents of crimes against women
recreating the violence
2010, 270 women were killed in a state? in Juarez?
2012, 700s
nowadays, 1000s
most adolescents 15 and 19 years of age
work in factories producing clothes, cheaply made and sold in US and Canada
sometimes outside of the city, have to walk or take bus
often kidnapped and killed along these paths

2005 - 2010
922 femicides

Not a phenomenon unique to Mexico, all over the world marginalized women are

### Elina Chauvet
from North of Mexico

Zapatos Rojos (2009 - today)
goes into ateliers that work with women, paint shoes, acquire shoes, donated, bought, found, recycled
placed with names of murdered/disappeared women
Installation deployed all over the world

### Christine Brault - ApareSer / aparÊtre (2019-2020)
Map of the Americas on the wall
samples of dirt from places where femicides occurred, from all over the Americas
Mixed, created mud in a container
Spread on her face, marked map with it, 
alternative map of the Americas
(illegal to transport dirt across borders! biological issues)
