# Characters Assignment

### eavesdropping
"Oh, do you think it's like a caramel macchiato?"
"IT'S NOT"

## toxic lesbian human-vampire couple
### dialogue
"Baby, I just– I'm just not sure if I can do this."
Laura sighs. It's small, but there's little attempt to hide it. "I thought we had already settled this. It's no different from what we usually do."
"You know it isn't. I just can't risk losing control like that. I can't risk hurting you."
"God, babe, listen to what you're saying. You have to stop feeling so–, so sorry for yourself." 

### short descriptions
possible names: Vic, Laura, Diane, Casey,

#### Laura
A shy antisocial 19-year old with a bit of a short fuse. Likes cute things, favourite activities are being at home, reading. Reads a lot of romance and horror. Studying creative writing.
#### Vic
A recent vampire, 21. Somewhat naturally charming, especially since being turned. Always been a people pleaser. Studying computer science, lived with her parents until beginning to see Laura. Liked to go out dancing and likes to play videogames

### thoughts, perspective
Vic is terrified of herself. She is all-too aware of her own capacity to cause pain in others and is very careful to avoid even putting herself in a situation where she might do so. As a vampire, she works very hard to only drink animal blood, avoiding even blood bank blood. Early on after being turned, under encouragement from the vampire who sired her, she killed a girl she picked up from a bar. Sometimes she still dreams of what her eyes looked like afterwards as she lay in the alley. She doesn't remember her name. Even before being turned, she was a people-pleaser, and here, she doesn't know what to do with Laura. She can't bare seeing Laura as that woman in the alley, she can't bare the fact that she likes how her blood tastes. She doesn't understand how Laura can't see the risk. 

What Vic doesn't see is that Laura does, deep down, understand the risk. Ever since Vic bit her during that fight, Laura can't stop thinking about how close she came to being drained, to not being. She has always felt small and that she is perceived as weak. She, in turn, is self-effacing as a result. Or is it the other way around? She is choosing to be blinded to Vic's pain and boundaries by her self-destructive desires and the admitted pleasure that accompanied it. In this moment she is frustrated by what she feels (somewhat truthfully) is Vic being held back by a negative self-image, something very true of Laura herself.

Ultimately, their dynamic keeps them from seeing the ways in which Laura is manipulating and hurting Vic.

I have admittedly been going back and forth on which one of them should have a short temper. As well as how adventurous Laura is. Or if Vic should be timid.

### actions
Vic is sitting on the edge of the bed, her leg is moving back and forth but she hasn't noticed yet. She hasn't been this close to another girl since Her. Laura is seeing into her eyes like staring at the stars. 

Her hand is firmly on Vic's thigh. 

Vic turns from the book on the shelf back to Laura.

They taste each other

A sun burns in the pit of Vic's stomach and she pulls away.
