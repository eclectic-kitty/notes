# Fiction Workshop - toxic vamp lesbians



I stare deep into her eyes, drinking in her hypnotized gaze for what feels like an eternity. I look down at her flushed lips that I know are just so, so soft. There's barely any reaction as I play with her hand in mine. I know she wouldn't be able to make the first move, even if she wanted to, but she's simply far too beautiful when she's like this. We could both stay here forever. 

Eventually, the pit in my stomach grows far too heavy, the ringing in my ears. My mouth is on hers in an instant. She's warm, so so warm. Her nails are in my back as I suck on her lower lip. I move down to her chin. Then, under, her neck. She shudders, but I know better than to give in right away. I move down towards her collarbone, bathed in the soft light from her bedside lamp.

"Vic, please," she whines.
"Patience, baby."
"Don'—"

Before she can finish, I'm sucking hard on the base of her neck and her breath hitches. I can feel the blood blooming under her skin. I taste her and I almost give in but Laura's whimper brings me back. I let go and move back for a moment. She barely seems to register what's going on and almost falls back into the mountain of pink fuzzy pillows on the bed behind her. 

I stare into her again. She stares back into me. 

I pounce and my fangs are in her artery. Her blood like thick sap pours down my throat, coating the sides in copper and my head is full of suns. I feel her breath leave her lungs in a moan and all her muscles go tense then soft and she collapses into me and I cradle her in my arms, holding her head up. She moves then, drawing me closer into her as much as she can.

I keep drinking and drinking and drinking, but. It's been too long. My fangs catch for a moment, but I pull away. The skin around the bite is far too white. Laura's eyes are just barely open. For a moment they seem empty and I see that woman in the alley. I could swear my heart began to beat again.

"Laura, honey, please, please," I scream. I slap her face and her eyes turn towards me. She struggles, but she focuses on me.

"Why did you stop?"

The question doesn't even make its way in. Tears are streaming down my face and I hold her head to my chest.

"Fuck, don't do that to me, please. I can't— I just can't."

It comes again. "Why did you stop?" This time it sticks.

"What do you mean? I almost lost you, you almost died, Laura. I don't know if I would have been able to stop."

"It felt so good."

That last one worms its way in. I look into her again. How could she not understand what I'm saying? She stares back into me, pleading. That's when it hits me. I held her close again, but now her warmth just feels suffocating.
