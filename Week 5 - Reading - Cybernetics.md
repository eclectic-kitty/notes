# Week 5 - Reading - Cybernetics

flourished from '40 to '70
universities had departments!

still useful, inspo for relationships between humans and technology 

**def:** field concerned with flow of information in all media

from Greek word for steersman
took shape from combo of feedback loop (older idea) and information (newer idea)
took shape mid '30s to '40s

early discussion = are animal human computer comparisons valid?
Claude Shannon's rat! William Gret Walter's tortoise!
model of neuron important
animal and human neurons capable of performing computational tasks, 
thus both bio and mechanical machines are cybernetic entities

Calude Shannon info theory
function of message probabilities
*still need to look into this more*
detaching info from meaning
-> disembodied flow b/ substrates & embodiments

Moravec: human brain nothing but info pattern, 
can be represented in any medium
cybernetic tendency = equate complex bio processes w/ simple mechanistic ones

alt info thoery, MacKay
more complex, less quantifiable, lost

**story of cybernetics:** struggle b/ simplifications necessary for quantifiable results and complex views w/ richer models but bad quantification

## 3 phases of cybernetics

### 1st order: simple mech.
'43 to '60
- homeostasis
- disembodied informatin
- self-regulation

simple mechanisms > complex bio org.
org./mechanism distinct from env.

### 2nd order: reflexivity
'60 to '85
observer as part of system
reflexivity = bringing framing mechanism into view
book: Observing Systems (pun!)

autopoetic theory
distinction b/ what observer sees and what system produces in own terms
observer can posit causal links b/ events in env. and animal behaviour
within system, everything happens in terms of sys. own org.
events outside can trigger events within, 
but **no** information passes b/
info and meaning reconnected
only as reflexive loops circulating within sys.

### 3d order: virtuality
from beg., interested in flow of info
humans animals and mach. all understood within framework

media
capacity to store, transmit, process info
humans and animals also media?
implicit in McCulloch-Pitts neuron
bodies coupled with other media
computational media
**cyber**space, **cyber**netics

virtuality, transition towards social condition that entangles frame and picture
before, cyber locations distinct from world
VR helmet
Now, GUI of computer
pervasive, flexible, robust, ubiquitous
media moves out of box and overalys virtual info and cuntion

**4th phase: mixed reality?**

Sterling, Shaping Things
spimes: virtual/actual entities, location trackable
object no longer prime reality, rather data in computational env.
object = hard copy output
spime = set of relationships
flow of info in all media

recap
- 1st flow of info in sys.
- 2nd interactions b/ observer and sys.
- 3d observer constr. in social and ling. env.

recap w. bouondaries
- 1st boundary b/ bio. and mech.
- 2nd boundary now includes ovserver
- 3d boundary places obs. & sys. in networked env. w/ info pervasively flowing

ult. boundary redrawing:
universe = giant computer
space & time are discrete, not cont.
focus away from info flows to comp. proc.

Fredkin: meaning of info. is given by proc. that interpret it
