## Nature: Keywords definitions

### Freewriting
How do I see or define nature?
*Is nature everything? IF it's anything that occurs naturally, surely anything we create is natural. It doesn't feel right. Maybe it should, but it doesn't.
Nature is systems in balance, in harmony. It's ecosystems, solar systems, celestial bodies in (mostly) stable orbit*


Meghan Moe Beitiks (she/they)
dep. of theatre
video, performance, installation
rigorous research with improvisation
analysing nature through lenses of site, history, emotions, and the body

Sabina Rak (she/her)
working, making, doing and undoing
mfa candidate in print media
humor and juxtaposition, interrogate reltaion b/ artist practice and nature as a resource

Yoojin Lee
london-based
across and between performance, sound, installation, text, video
centers keyword sleep to emobyd ways of knowing and becominf through care, resistance and multiple temporalities

### Q - Moe, artist statement: interactive network that links practice to various actors in nature, culture and structure. What does it mean to work at the intersection of these three words?

articulating what they work with/in
structure: production manager
structures dictate culture, impacts ecology
Systems and network theory nerdery
recognising diff. systems that have shaped their practice
wide spectrum of tools from performance they draw on

Untitled (Desert Refractions)
residency at Rogers art loft in Las Vegas
Desert!
sealed casino resorts!
reflected light
Shelley, Ozymandias
Opulence in the middle of a desert (Trump Tower)
gold windows
ecological reality of desert, **sun**
dressed as tourist employees

### Q - Sabina

wild nature left by city to encourage dev. of ecosystem
reproducing from Peruvian Jungles via cardboard
presenting to herself and recording via Zoom, during pandemic
wihtout aim of art gesture, he feels like he means nothing

### Q - Yoojin, cycles of sleep we think of as natural increasingly mediated by technology, site to explore human nature???
time and temporality
conceptualised through cyclical events, celestial bodies
experienced, not kept (timekeeping)
timekeeping devices, mobilised, miniaturised
fragmented, microscopic, supposedly precise time
entered our body w/ sharp precision
standardised time
7 days of the week, cycle feels natural, very much a construct
normalisation of time, how we should experience it, manage it

sleep <-> body <-> temporality
unruly, cumbersome body
light & darkness
used to rely on natural light
dev. technologies of light: bonfire, torches, electric light
We receive information as light
emotions as light

**Molly-Claire? host**
sun and light and time, forces we can't escape from
nature: what is not modified by human time
we think we can escape but
time and sun impacts all of us

### Q - what has nature meant in your discipline, historically?'

**Sabina:** in print-making probably
documentary work a side thing during pandemic, connecting through screen
in print,
processes for creation
utilises ink, paper, water
rethinking how to function while minimising waist

**Moe:** object oriented ontology?
western culture discovering animinism
"wowwww" - other cultures
**materials as being alive, having liveness**
*love this so much*
Everything has come from a resource material on the Earth
sustainability on a practical level,
valuing impact of art
live performance inherently lessening carbon impact: gathering a bunch of people in one place, not expending resources as much
How do I think about the experience of a table? a plant?
absurd: will never understand
experiment might still be worthwhile, generative, even if they don't answer question simply

**Yoojin:** not sure what discipline she belongs to nowadays
More visual art background
upbringing with certain animisit approach to life
what does this thing want?
where does it overlap with me?
starting from a body, either herself or another
gifs in video
**does a gif ever sleep? does it want to go to sleep**
*ooooh, love this too*
nature conceptualised in sleep
**understanding others through sleep
What does your bed look like?**
relationships we all have with everything around us

**moe** mentioned black power naps
we are physical bodies existing in ecologies
it's not enough to just greenify existing 

### Q audience, artificial? something phony? phone? instinct we have towards this

**Moe:** something not being real doesn't mean it doesn't have an impact
traveled around teaching hippie sustainability stuff for a while
very specific ideas of what is authentic, natural
what constitutes authentic performance?
is the video documentation not part of it? 
question not is it authentically the same, what is it doing?

**Sabina** Crits
there is no phony or real, all about context than the piece itself
response can vary based on so many factors, not be all end all

### Q is a choce feeling natural an element in the practice or something to be questioned

**Moe** questions it, where does it come from?
what feels natural to one may not for another
why do I feel something is more cological than something else

### Q nature as othering of everything what it is, bifurcation, human made, if you can say it is it real? 

Sabina Nature does not have aim, does not care about human
absurdity of making sense

Moe theory and embodiment

### My Q about nature and systems!

Donella Meadows - dancing with systems
very readable
an ethical standpoint for engaging with systems
computer networks leading to a rise in systems thinking in the West
was the information you're giving to the system? is it real nd being honoured
does the system has wisdom
what is the goal of the system, the goodness of the whole?
what they try to do **in their work:**
THink about what they're not thinking about
systems they're connected to, not seeing them
how to acknowledge them within space of the work
where did this random thougoht come from? 80's movie influenced by a war!
at some point you have to stop and make the work and not just go everything is connected!!! (even thouugh it is)
recent work:
pain recovery and trauma
one of the hangups was them trying to articulate a wide universalism
keenly understanding one's blindspots within a system and making space for where you're connected to it
blabla
Jack burnham - systems aesthetics
systems based artworks in 60s and 70s

Sabina
artist ego has to be kept in check

### DO you think we can find nature within virtuality? Materiality of virtuality

Yookin
trying to keep in mind that there is nature within every **body**
virtual interactions based on materiality
fibre optic cables, screens, radio waves
**under the ocean, rotting away slowly**
inconsequential seeming text message has very real 
in video: battery running low message on macbook, one can see Yoojin
