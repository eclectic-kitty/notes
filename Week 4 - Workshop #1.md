# Week 4 - Workshop #1

## Melody's Piece
1. **What were your first impressions as a reader?** You might consider the following to help guide your impressions: What stood out to you? What was compelling, surprising, memorable, difficult, unique, and/or confusing?
	- I was immediately struck by the use of the word "mommy" as an opening and the way it instantly put me into a child's perspective. It's extremely disarming. Throughout the piece, it's use continuously pulls me back into this state and it never quite becomes easy to hear.
	- There's also a strong contrast between the tragic more adult thoughts and the moments that feel a lot more childlike and nostalgic, which I found compelling
2. **What is the story “about”?** Is there a central theme or subject? How about a narrative arc?
	- The story seems to centre on themes of nostalgia, death, transformation, growing up, and emotional resilience.
	- There seems to pointedly be an almost non-arc, with the narrator remaining somewhat unable to accept their mother's illness, but perhaps trying to learn from it.
3. **How does the piece convey its intent?** This is different from the piece’s content; the intention refers to what the writing is trying to achieve, its underlying purpose, or its “why”. What aspects of creative nonfiction, such as personal anecdotes, memory, mood, thematic exploration, and description, are used to convey the piece? How does the author develop these aspects and what effect do they have on the overall narrative?
	- The intent seems to be to explore how difficult accepting change and transformation can be, as well as how nostalgia interacts with this desire, both hindering it by allowing you to avoid dealing with it, but also acting as a safe space by giving you respite from the difficulty of this process
4. **What aspects of the piece are working well?** Consider elements like narrative structure, pacing, point of view, style, and audience. What aspects could be strengthened, and how might these improvements be made?
	- As mentioned before, I think the use of the word mommy does a great job in instilling both discomfort due to its suddenness, while also putting one in the headspace of a child.
	- 
5. **Develop one or two questions to ask your peers** such as, what inspired you to write this piece? What challenges did you face during the writing process? Can you elaborate on a particular passage, approach or theme you included? Are there earlier drafts of this piece, and if so, how did it evolve? What are your goals for future iterations of the piece?

## Feedback
Surroundings changing
Journal-like, stream of consciousness
Shocking intro, attention-grabbing
magic, seeing **glitter**
cool foreshadowing

seems to be about a love interest, some doubt
some level of abstraction
left out some interests

**nostalgically** writing to a **lost** lover, not shown by them

intent is conveyed via spell theme, love spell, sandwiching 
spell components came through, present
abstract intent, vivid imagery

Confusing timeline came through ^_^

working well: prose, stream of consciousness, poetics
strength or weakness? info hidden!
Unusual cliffhanger sentences could be emphasized!!! (encouraging!)

blocks? obsessing over words
