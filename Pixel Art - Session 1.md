# Pixel Art - Session 1

Pixel art is about **control** and **limitation**
Placing pixels in specific spots

Start small:
- small size
	- ex. 16x16
- small amount of colours
	- ex. 4, 6, 8 colours max

Typical 2d art process: linework, colouring, refine

Terms to know:

**Antialiasing**
Soft edges around strokes
blending colours
Good to add afterwards?
Often lines

**Dithering**
Adding texture by alternating colours
blending colours
Good for limited colours
Good for skies or vast backgrounds (softer or grainier look)

EX. Street Fighter Alpha 2 
Good ex. of dithering
gives grainy look
high res

Ex. Ecco the Dolphin
high res
antialising in border to keep it together
far away
stuck to checker pattern

Dithering variations
- checkered
- parallel lines
	- used for CRT TVs
- discontinued lines
- intertwined dithering
	- tricky!
- random dithering
	- seems too random, grainy
- stylized
	- pattern in dithering
	ex. Yoshi's island

Bad ex.
When you have too much dithering
when it's too low res to blend in
When there's too much contrast between colours
becomes messy and unreadable

orphan pixels
Single pixels
Often considered bad practice
can look messy

**Things to avoid**

Too much antialising
looking blurry when zoomed out
can make lines thicker

Too little
Doesn't have much of an effect

Banding
multiple rows/columns of antialising
lines stacked up against each other

Jaggies
Bad linework
Irregular escalation
Ex. 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2 vs. 2, 1, 2, 2, 2

Pillow shading
Only shadows around edges
not taking light source into account
flattens image

**Colours & palettes**
Easy to start with predetermined, limited palette

Places to find palettes
Lospec: specifically for pixel art
Adobe Colour: making own palette
Color Hunt

Nice palettes!
SLSO8 palette
Pear 36
OIL 6
Kirokaze Gameboy
1-bit monitor glow

**Hue shifting**

Color systems:
RGB: red, gree, blue
Used for coding/web
CMYK
Used for printing
HSV: hue, saturation, value
good for art!
HSL: hue, saturation, lightness
less intuitive, l changes other values

highlights: warmer, higher saturation
shadows: cooler, lower saturation
Not always the case
Ex. golden, yellow colours, shadows tend to be warmer to go towards an orange
Use your best judgement!
