# Week 7 - In-Class - Donna Haraway Day

Donna Haraway
biologist, trained to see as conversation

Donna Haraway, why is it her day today?
While I don't think I hadn't heard the idea before today

## Video
Fundamental wounds to narcissism of humanists
Copernicus: decentering of Earth from centre of universe
Darwin: decentering of humanity from centre of life
Freud: decentering consciousness from what is interesting about modes of being, active agencies, active beings
Synthetic: decentering of the natural in general from the artificial

entities that we call technological, have liveliness
relational network, clan, tribe, family, etc.
machinic, organic, humanic, spectrum
inversion of what's interior

Anna Tsing: making scale
tracing mushroom from life in forest to plate in gourmet resto

## Cyborg Manifesto
boundaries
liminality
cyborg world could be a grid of control, or a symbiotic relation
both perspectives at once
universal totalizing theory = major mistake
future = murky
spiral dance, attuned to the earth, new age Wiccan movements
heteroglossia: different tongue, confluence of emergent languages
evolving in symbiosis
not an individual who can get ahead in a system,
you **are** the system

## Writing theory

**Find your questions?**
it can start simple
questions evoke focused curiosity and motivation

**Define your terms**
All of them
can seem trivial
but it gathers all your materials

**research**
Who else is in the field? How?
contours of an idea
ecosystem of epistemological explorations
living system

**constrain, refine your scope**
What is your specific subject?
will not be able to solve the existential mystery of existence
breadth?
depth?
what's feasible and not?

**Generalise to find impact**
making scale
how does the function of a button have a larger impact?

**list of techniques:**
- relax
- enjoy
- play
- work
- research
- debate
- evolve
- practice
- explore
- inspire
- evoke
- entangle

**Be honest
Listen to your mind**
whenever you encounter something, don't just trash it
put it in a document called discards if you want

**Trust your own thought
Use what you encounter in everyday life**

## Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Cthulucene: Staying with the Trouble

Cthulucene
sunken, forgotten ones
makes Gaia seem like a kindergartener

unthinkable to do good work in any field w/ individualism
one must be a many to be anything at all
how is the name of our epoch that is proposed is the anthropocene
anthropos, contradiction to name it that way
the people have somewhat changed all of this

Virginia Woolfe: think, we must
if evere there has been a time, it is now
Eichmann, banality of evil, condensed to inability to think of the world as it is
limiting of thinking to functionality, business as usual, 
Eichmann was incapable of thinking

it matters what thoughts think thoughts
what worlds world worlds

non-euclidean view of california is a cold place to be

sf
string figures
...

it matters to destabilize
worlds of thinking with worlds of thinking
to be less parochial

Ursula K LeGuin
carrier bags
rethinking questions of evolution
negative spaces, hollowed out
not the heroic story
map of always coming home

anthropocene
eugene stermer
lover of diatoms
biologist
processes acidifying waters
picked up by chemist
bleached corals

figure of anthropocene: fossil-making man burning fossils
grew from a small effigy to a huge one
copyright owned by org.

gaia
emerges into consciousness of anthropos from space
an it, not female
metabolism of a planet
autopoiesis, system theory
accomodates collapse
producing the scale called global

not arguing we don't need these operations
specifying historical limitations
anthopocene's main biological sciences:
modern evolutionary synthesis
no grip in microbiology
could not deal with symbiosis

anthropocene did not do this extinction
rather it was the **capitalocene**
need to go to mid-18th century
formation of markets
30% of natural gas reserves in the arctic
melting arctic ice is v important
sucking the last calories out of the earth

Cthulucene
*chaotic view of gaia system
we're not changing the system, just the packaging*
cthonic ones
tentacles on face, feelers, not eyes
ood: minds outside of their bodies
hive mind, communication

lynn margoules
symbiogenesis
active indigestion
squid with bacteria it needs for bioluminescence to catch its prey

we are all lichens now
infection is necessary to complexity

reworlding
compost, not posthuman
cthonic powers near oour grasp
collecting garbage from other -cenes 

move us away from existential angst of Lovecraft

## 30 second reflections
annihilation, collapsing into our interconnectedness with everything
**destabilization is a positive**
humans are **not** the centre
banality of evil, momentum of a particle in a system
the tale-tellers
something allows us to be general purpose not yet present in machines, likes individualism
likes how in the lecture she pauses to rethink how she'll phrase idea
**privacy & rights in the realm of the cyborg, the breakdown of the individual**
a little essentialist, connected to Butler and Zizek
investigate the questions borught up by the reading
cyborgs negate genesis?
_ religious genesis, singular act of creation, first there was nothing, and then there was light
hinduism and budhism, denying body and mind, disagrees with individualism, as humans can't be defined into singular organism

what is the place of ghosts in our cthulucene? How do these deep ones affect us in ways we may not notice? how do we worship them?
