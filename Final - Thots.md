# Final - Thots

## Alan Wake 2

### Thread 1: mediums
Alan Wake 2 presents different component mediums of videogames very clearly and separate from each other

#### Examples:
- Live action Dark Place scenes
- Alice's recordings for Alan
- Saga's telepathy
- Alan's writing
- Yoton Yo
- End-of-chapter songs
- Koskela commercials
- Night Springs episodes
- Alan writing scenes

#### Effects:
- Strengthens the game's surrealism
- Undermines & strengthens immersion
	- Reminds player of difference between game world and real world
	- At same time, makes characters seem more real
- Calls attention to fabricated nature of work

#### Class Concepts
- Ludology v. narratology
	- Strengthens importance of analysing game with different lenses (ludology for gameplay, narratology for plot, film studies for visual elements)
- identification
	- Could discourage identifying *as* characters, given that they are portrayed by real people,
	- Could encourage identifying with, as it lends depth to the characters

### Thread 2: rituals
Alan Wake 2 has the player/Saga & Alan perform various rituals throughout the game, featuring loops (spirals) as a core theme

#### examples
- overlap rituals
	- witch's heart
	- brother's murder
	- Tor's song
	- special items
	- special ordering of time
- overlaps
	- repetition
	- special place
- Dark Ocean Summoning
	- Appeal to another
	- Hoping to bring about a change in the world through art, ritual
	- Weird time stuff (special ordering of time))
- Alan's murder scenes
	- Recreating the scenes
	- Meant to appeal to him, his ego
	- Certain order of events (special ordering of time)
- Alan's loops
	- Waking up, talking to door
	- Enacting one of his murder scenes
	- Returning to the 
- Game itself
	- It's all a big ~~loop~~ spiral! Enacting the story Alan has written
	- Eventually leading to his ascension
	- While reinforcing itself
	- Gameplay loop of burning darkness before shooting
	- Hero's journey
		- His three books
- Nursery rhymes
	- Recreating stories
	- Archetypes

- Gameplay
	- Gameplay loops:
		- Taken/shadow encounters
			- Weakening & stunning enemies w/ flashlight
			- Shooting enemies
			- Or running
			- Managing resources
		- Arranging case/plot board
			- Serves to connect player to the narrative ritual/play
		- Searching for collectibles & clues
		- 
	- Narrative loops
		- Talking to characters
		- Considering mysteries
		- Facing scares

#### Thematic effects
- Relating the work of bettering one's self to rituals
	- Not a linear process, involves repetition
		- One *will* make mistakes, feel like they're restarting as they work on themselves
	- Appealing to a higher power?
		- One's self?
		- Or bettering yourself for the others around you?
		- Connection to programs like AA?
	- Difficult work
	- A transition in life
- Relating artistic work to rituals
	- Not a linear process, involves repetition
		- Creation is a constant process of editing, rewriting, starting over, whittling away, etc.
		- Interconnected with past and future
	- Appealing to a higher power
		- Appealing to an audience, their taste, their experiences
		- Appealing to Truth, Beauty
		- Appealing to ideals, emotions, etc.
	- Difficult work
	- Communication with and forming of communities


#### Miscellaneous
- Something about losing control of one's work, the ritual/piece having its own life
- Something about all of Alan's doubles, Zane & Scratch
	- Each loop, both small and large ending with him being shot
	- And the Dark presence possessing him/being created
	- Him writing and rewriting, not necessarily remembering
	- Zane having written Alan's childhood memory into the story for the first game
	- Zane as a figure reappearing changed, another archetype, facet of Alan
		- He's a lot like Alan pre-first-game, party animal, egotistical, etc.
- History of various artists interfacing with the lake
	- Each performing their own ritual
	- Rituals are *required* to use powers
- Talk show
	- Another kind of performance, ritual
	- Audience, purpose to make money
	- Standard structure and ordering of time
	- Preselected questions
- "All these convoluted loops you insist on going through"
- "I don't think you even know who's under your mask"
- "You would do well to return the favor by playing your part..."
- "There's so much rage inside of him and I just can't stand it anymore"
- "People call me an artist but I just wanted to show the world what I see"
- "It's time for a perspective shift, to go from artist to art"
- "I had to mislead you to get you to where you need to be"
- Loop connections
	- Zane
		- Alan gives up on writing
		- Scratch offers Zane with help escaping, writes Return
		- Alan shows back up, is told he wrote Return
		- Later again, is told Scratch left Zane and took the book (but he's still around)
		- Told he shouldn't hesitate to kill Scratch
		- Back and forth, Zane being gleeful and looking evil
		- Alan shoots Zane
	- Writer's room
		- First* loop:
			- He finds himself dead, with Return finished
			- Before he's able to do much, he's possessed by the Dark Presence
		- Second* loop:
			- He finds the writer's room empty, with the first draft of Return
			- Starts to edit it, scratch things out,
			- Writes Saga into the story
			- Is killed by himself
		- Third* loop:
			- Alan, thinking Alice has killed herself, enters
			- Finds himself editing the manuscript
			- Thinks it's Scratch, shoots himself
			- Realizing, gives up, 
			- is possessed by the Dark Presence
		- Escape:
			- Comes out of the dark place, possessed
			- After some time, Scratch comes out, wants clicker
			- Scratch is burned out of him, but possess Casey instead
			- Scratch's Return is made real,
				- Everyone loves Alan and Return
			- Alan returns to the writer room, edits ending w/ Saga
		- Final loop:
			- Saga meets Alan in the writer's room
			- Casey appears
			- With Return & clicker, Dark Presence is forced out of Casey
			- Re-enters Alan
			- Saga shoots Alan w/ bullet of light
			- Same as opening of game (shining bullet hole, darkness behind)
#### Talking with Kelsey
	
Present in the narratological and ludological elements
Bringing a ludological element explicitly into the narrative
Recontextualize typical videogame elements (the idea of the gameplay loop) 

What is it for? WHat does this do?

#### Poem

Lost on the shore
Between the forest and the ocean
The owl and the deer
Reflected in motion

In his room, he will hurt her
In hers, he is caught
His story ends
Her story does not

//

A pale balloon in the sky 
Float and sink deeper 
Night springs when bright falls 
For this sleeper 

The surface disturbed 
The reflection now a traitor 
In the cavity of a skull 
Turned to a crater 

//

This is the ritual
To lead you on
Your friends will meet him
When you are gone 

#### Class concepts
- Performance theory
	- rituals
		- What is the ritual of playing the game communicating?
			- By playing the game, the player partakes in the ritual, the performance of the game
			- One can learn the lessons Alan learns, perhaps?
				- Players have to face the same fears as Alan & Saga
			- Or not learn, but receive, emote, identify with
			- The game's events can be seen as a ritual of letting go that Alan needs to perform over and over again before understanding
			- This can be connected to the drive of people to create art and how that helps one deal with emotions
		- Separation, Liminal, Reaggregation - rites of passage
			- During the liminal phase for us, 
				- We are stripped of our individual identities and given new ones?
				- the game's coded rules are the authority we have to follow
				- The controller is given special meaning
- Ludology
- Narratology

- "Ritual not only commu­nicates something but is taken by those performing it to
be 'doing something' as well" - Rappaport, Ecology, Meaning, and Religion
- "Rituals enhance clear communications because they are exaggerated, over­ determined, redundant, and repetitious. Ritual’s insistent metamessage is, 'You get the message, don’t you?!' " - Schechner, Performance Studies, an Introduction, chap. 5
- "...they make men forget the real world and transport them into another where their imagination is more at ease; they distract." - Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life
- "In play, the transformations are temporary, bounded by the
rules of the game or the conventions of the genre" - Schechner, Performance Studies, An Introduction

## Kentucky Route Zero
KRZ puts player in role of actor, playing and thus making interpretive choices about its characters
