# Final - Thots

## Outline / Planning
### Outline
- Main arg: ~~Comparing rituals to the process of personal growth illuminates how one can get stuck following unhealthy behavioural/cognitive patterns as well as the need to persevere despite repeated failure.~~
Refined: Comparing the process of personal growth to a ritual illuminates the process of personal growth.
	- Arg. 1: *Rituals and personal growth are both effective; they seek to achieve a goal.*
		- Under Schechner's performance spectrum, rituals are (in part) differentiated by a focus on efficacy
			- AWII features art and other rituals having a direct effect on reality
		- More specifically, personal growth practices can be seen as a kind of liminal ritual, seeking some kind of transformation (set of liminoid rituals having a liminal effect?)
			- Connection with typical Western narrative structure, monomyth being a cycle of transformation
			- A lot of thresholds in AWII, references to monomyth
	- Arg. 2: *The authority of a ritual mirrors how unhealthy behaviour reinforces itself.*
		- Rituals, as very structured performances with set rules, usually carry with them religious or social authority, as well as a construction of history / state of being
			- In AWII, Alan feels the need to stick to conventions, as well as elements of the story that already exist / have been written in by Scratch
			- The bosses are all characters who are made to fit within established stories, then recreated by Saga to encounter them
		- The belief that one is a bad person carries with it a certain authority, is a prescriptive statement about one's self
			- Alan prescribes to himself the alternating roles of victim and monster, impeding his escape (growth)
			- The murders Alan writes are cult murders, those who perform them are acting on the authority of the cult, and Alan in turn
			- "This is the ritual to lead you on"
	- Arg. 3: *The constructed nature of rituals mirrors how one's construction of self can affect reinforce new behaviours.*
		- However, rituals' rules are not set in stone, despite how they might feel, and can change to better fit the practitioners' goals
			- History of invented rituals
			- The Cult of the Word bases their rituals entirely around Alan's writing, something very new
			- Simlarly, the Torchbearers & Cult of the Tree see Alan as a figure to revere or fear
		- Similarly, it is ultimately within one's power to change how they think of themselves and utilize that authority in service of personal goals
			- Ultimately, Alan's escape is only possible by changing what he considers possible to write into the story, ie casting himself as a hero
	- Arg. 4: Power of repetition?
	- Arg. 5: Power of community?
		- Learning to accept help from Saga
		- Saga and Alan communicating through overlaps
		- As well as through their powers

### Refining planning
- vague: ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the processes of personal growth and art creation
- elements:
	- getting stuck in unhealthy patterns
	- non-linear processes
		- one will fail and make mistakes
		- repetition, starting over, is an inherent part of the process
	- Ultimately, a lot of the difficulty is internal, which means it is within our power to escape
		- still difficult

- Elements of rituals:
	- Rules, script 
		- Carry authority
			- Explanation
				- Can propel one through a difficult process, despite being scary, one doesn't have a choice
				- Can also make someone feel less responsible
			- **Meaning**
				- Getting stuck in self-destructive patterns - thinking one *is* bad becomes an excuse for doing bad things, allowing one to sshirk responsibility
		- Are artificial, fabricated, not natural
			- Explanation
				- Despite how it might feel, they can be changed
			- **Meaning**
				- We have the power to change our own behaviour, we don't have to follow these *rules*
	- Focus on efficacy
		- Unlike other types of performance these processes could be compared to, rituals are most associated with some kind of purpose they are trying to achieve
		- In fact there is a whole set of rituals called liminal rituals that directly serve the purpose of helping the ritual's practitioner with a big life change
			- Connection to monomyth, the idea of character arcs
			- Ultimately the whole game's events is one of these rituals
			- liminal rituals
		- This should come first, as it *validates* my focus on rituals as the type of performance 
			- Maybe I could talk about more general performance elements beforehand, before honing in on rituals as key to understanding Alan's and Saga's journey
	- ///
	- Community?
		- Could perhaps be related to Alan learning to accept help from others? To hear others' perspective?
	- Repetition?
		- Behaviour, whether healthy or not, is self-reinforcing, bringing something into being?
		- Despite an apparent lack of direct effect, something shifts beneath the surface, repeating can over time produce an effect

### Planning ðŸ˜¯ (elements from assignment instructions)
- topic
	- Use of ritual imagery
- clearly define key terms
	- see bolded words
-  case study
	- Alan Wake 2
- state your main argument(s)
	- The game invokes the concept of rituals to illuminate the process of personal growth
		- spiral as a nesting doll of rituals (ritualistically engaging in bad behaviour, recognising bad behaviour and source, working to change it, restarting, non-linear)
			- Repeating **liminoid** rituals, creating a **liminal** ritual
		- Needing to perform ritual repetitively in order to enact change slowly /
		Needing an archetype to follow, a destiny
			- **Restored behaviour**, set of pre-established actions
			- **Hero's journey**
		- A ritual carries authority and rules with it, but these are not fixed
		- Where does this authority come from? For Alan, it is internal, so he has the power to directly change it
		- But also, because it is internal, without external help, he is ultimately doomed to only repeat and never truly change
			- Unable to escape the framing of himself as victim/monster
		- Saga (Alice) teaches him the importance of writing your own story
			- Collaboration, different perspectives, alternative to monomyth
- why your topic and/or argument matters.
	- Understanding why this game connected with me
	- Blurring between art and ritual
		- **Efficacy**

### Discarded writing

During his captivity, Wake is stuck in perpetual loops of attempting to escape the Dark Place by writing stories, as the Dark Place embues art with reality-altering powers. These stories take the form of horror stories about ritualistic murders involving Wake's evil double, Scratch, who was created by the Dark Place to stop him. These attempts consistently fail however, as Wake believes that he must stick to what he perceives as the genre conventions of horror, namely that all the characters fall into the roles of monsters or victims. Through the lens of performance theory, these conventions he sticks to when writing can be seen as the rules of certain kinds of performances, namely rituals. By only writing within these rules, however, he ultimately writes himself in as alternatively a victim and a monster, forgetting each time the loop resets.


## Alan Wake 2

### Thread 1: mediums
Alan Wake 2 presents different component mediums of videogames very clearly and separate from each other

#### Examples:
- Live action Dark Place scenes
- Alice's recordings for Alan
- Saga's telepathy
- Alan's writing
- Yoton Yo
- End-of-chapter songs
- Koskela commercials
- Night Springs episodes
- Alan writing scenes

#### Effects:
- Strengthens the game's surrealism
- Undermines & strengthens immersion
	- Reminds player of difference between game world and real world
	- At same time, makes characters seem more real
- Calls attention to fabricated nature of work

#### Class Concepts
- Ludology v. narratology
	- Strengthens importance of analysing game with different lenses (ludology for gameplay, narratology for plot, film studies for visual elements)
- identification
	- Could discourage identifying *as* characters, given that they are portrayed by real people,
	- Could encourage identifying with, as it lends depth to the characters

### Thread 2: rituals
Alan Wake 2 has the player/Saga & Alan perform various rituals throughout the game, featuring loops (spirals) as a core theme

#### examples
- overlap rituals
	- witch's heart
		- Finding the heart, placing it in the witch and reciting the poetry
	- brother's murder
		- Arranging all the items and placing them on the float
	- Tor's song
		- Finding and playing the record
	- special items
	- special ordering of time
- overlaps
	- repetition
	- special place
	- Boss characters taking on established archetypes
		- Nightingale = witch
		- Thornton & Mulligan = brothers' story
		- Cynthia = drowned teenage girl
- Dark Ocean Summoning
	- Appeal to another? Wake?
	- Hoping to bring about a change in the world through art, ritual
	- Weird time stuff (special ordering of time))
- Alan's murder scenes
	- Recreating the scenes
	- Meant to appeal to him, his ego
	- Certain order of events (special ordering of time)
- Alan's loops
	- Waking up, talking to door
	- Enacting one of his murder scenes
	- Returning to the 
- Story itself
	- It's all a big ~~loop~~ spiral! Enacting the story Alan has written
	- Eventually leading to his ascension
	- While reinforcing itself
	- Hero's journey
		- His three books, Departure, Initiation, Return
- Gameplay loop of burning darkness before shooting
- Nursery rhymes
	- Recreating stories
	- Archetypes
	- Most direct player participation
- Gameplay
	- Gameplay loops:
		- Taken/shadow encounters
			- Weakening & stunning enemies w/ flashlight
			- Shooting enemies
			- Or running
			- Managing resources
		- Arranging case/plot board
			- Serves to connect player to the narrative ritual/play
		- Searching for collectibles & clues
		- Nursery rhymes
	- Narrative loops
		- Talking to characters
		- Considering mysteries
		- Facing scares

#### Thematic effects
- Relating the work of bettering one's self to rituals
	- Not a linear process, involves repetition
		- One *will* make mistakes, feel like they're restarting as they work on themselves
	- Appealing to a higher power?
		- One's self?
		- Or bettering yourself for the others around you?
		- Connection to programs like AA?
	- Difficult work
	- A transition in life
- Relating artistic work to rituals
	- Not a linear process, involves repetition
		- Creation is a constant process of editing, rewriting, starting over, whittling away, etc.
		- Interconnected with past and future
	- Appealing to a higher power
		- Appealing to an audience, their taste, their experiences
		- Appealing to Truth, Beauty
		- Appealing to ideals, emotions, etc.
	- Difficult work
	- Communication with and forming of communities


#### Miscellaneous
- Something about losing control of one's work, the ritual/piece having its own life
- Something about all of Alan's doubles, Zane & Scratch
	- Each loop, both small and large ending with him being shot
	- And the Dark presence possessing him/being created
	- Him writing and rewriting, not necessarily remembering
	- Zane having written Alan's childhood memory into the story for the first game
	- Zane as a figure reappearing changed, another archetype, facet of Alan
		- He's a lot like Alan pre-first-game, party animal, egotistical, etc.
- History of various artists interfacing with the lake
	- Each performing their own ritual
	- Rituals are *required* to use powers
- Talk show
	- Another kind of performance, ritual
	- Appeal to other? celebrity? advertising?
	- Standard structure and ordering of time
	- Preselected questions
- Organizing loops
	- Zane
		- Alan gives up on writing
		- Scratch offers Zane with help escaping, writes Return
		- Alan shows back up, is told he wrote Return
		- Later again, is told Scratch left Zane and took the book (but he's still around)
		- Told he shouldn't hesitate to kill Scratch
		- Back and forth, Zane being gleeful and looking evil
		- Alan shoots Zane
	- Writer's room
		- First* loop:
			- He finds himself dead, with Return finished
			- Before he's able to do much, he's possessed by the Dark Presence?
		- Second* loop:
			- He finds the writer's room empty, with the first draft of Return
			- Starts to edit it, scratch things out,
			- Writes Saga into the story
			- Is killed by himself
		- Third* loop:
			- Alan, thinking Alice has killed herself, enters
			- Finds himself editing the manuscript
			- Thinks it's Scratch, shoots himself
			- Realizing, gives up, 
			- is possessed by the Dark Presence
		- Escape:
			- Comes out of the dark place, possessed
			- After some time, Scratch comes out, wants clicker
			- Scratch is burned out of him, but possesses Casey instead
			- Scratch's Return is made real,
				- Everyone loves Alan and Return
			- Alan returns to the writer room, edits ending w/ Saga
		- Final* loop:
			- Saga meets Alan in the writer's room
			- Casey appears
			- With Return & clicker, Dark Presence is forced out of Casey
			- Re-enters Alan
			- Saga shoots Alan w/ bullet of light
			- Same as opening of game (shining bullet hole, darkness behind)

### Quotes
- "All these convoluted loops you insist on going through"
- "I don't think you even know who's under your mask"
- "You would do well to return the favor by playing your part..."
- "There's so much rage inside of him and I just can't stand it anymore"
- "People call me an artist but I just wanted to show the world what I see"
- "It's time for a perspective shift, to go from artist to art"
- "I had to mislead you to get you to where you need to be"
- Opening monologue
	- Back to the beginning.
	- We all come to a story with hopes and expectations, looking for an answer.
	- Sometimes it would be better to live with that hope without ever knowing the full story.
	- In a horror story, there are only victims and monsters, and the trick is not to end up as either.
	- But, trapped by the genre, we are all ripped to pieces along the way.
	- This is not the story I hoped it would be.
	- This is not the ending I wanted.
	- This story will eat us alive.
	- This story is a monster.
- Loop monologue
	- Back to the beginning, with the memory of the past loop already fading fast.
	- But while it lingers, I know there's hope.
	- We're not doomed to repeat our failures in an eternal loop.
	- This is a spiral.
	- A fictional poet once said: beyond the shadow you settle for, there is a miracle illuminated.
	- I will not settle for a shadow.
	- I'll find the miracle, through the night.
	- It's not just victims and monsters.
	- I see now there are heroes as well.
	- We can find our way through the darkness.
	- We will break through the surface.
	- We will emerge, into the light.
- Ending monologue
	- What lies under the surface now shifts. A play of shadows catching my eye. Thrusting my face into the water - it's shockingly cold - past the mirror of the surface, and I will see
	- A white searing light of truth, that for a flash, pierces the shadows and reveals the hidden horror. And in that moment of silence, the whispered message, finally heard.
	- What if there's nothing waiting to be revealed? The play of shadows fooled us all. Subterfuge to get our price of admission. Darkness not as a monster, but as emptiness. We are none the wiser. No answers. No truths. 
	- The hero turns to look inside, is destroyed by what he sees, and is redeemed. Saga said we're both heroes. I'll pay the price. so will she. We are here to kill the monster. I pray nothing comes after, nothing but sleep.
	- This is how we win. Is it too easy? What if this is still the dark place? Another dream to wake up from. Always coming back to the beginning. The memory of what came before burned away by this terrible realisation. Maybe it's a mercy, forgetting. To know nothing when we loop around, back to -

#### Talking with Kelsey


Why?
What is that ritual structure doing?

Doing just a narratological analysis, a close reading, is **fine**
Why does it matter that it's using ritual?

narratological and ludological representations of rituals recontextualises the typical structure of videogames

procedural rhetoric?
	
Present in the narratological and ludological elements
Bringing a ludological element explicitly into the narrative
Recontextualize typical videogame elements (the idea of the gameplay loop) 

What is it for? What does this do?

What are rituals for?
Instead of trying to exert control on the world,
Alan needs to change internally

#### Poem

Lost on the shore
Between the forest and the ocean
The owl and the deer
Reflected in motion

In his room, he will hurt her
In hers, he is caught
His story ends
Her story does not

//

A pale balloon in the sky 
Float and sink deeper 
Night springs when bright falls 
For this sleeper 

The surface disturbed 
The reflection now a traitor 
In the cavity of a skull 
Turned to a crater 

//

This is the ritual
To lead you on
Your friends will meet him
When you are gone 

#### Class concepts
- Performance theory
	- rituals
		- What is the ritual of playing the game communicating?
			- By playing the game, the player partakes in the ritual, the performance of the game
			- One can learn the lessons Alan learns, perhaps?
				- Players have to face the same fears as Alan & Saga
			- Or not learn, but receive, emote, identify with
			- The game's events can be seen as a ritual of letting go that Alan needs to perform over and over again before understanding
			- This can be connected to the drive of people to create art and how that helps one deal with emotions
		- Separation, Liminal, Reaggregation - rites of passage
			- During the liminal phase for us, 
				- We are stripped of our individual identities and given new ones?
				- the game's coded rules are the authority we have to follow
				- The controller is given special meaning
- Ludology
- Narratology
