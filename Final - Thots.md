# Final - Thots

## Questions
- What has driven this movement of artwork made with intentionally poor images?
	- What are the artistic purposes for it?
	- What are the techno-political reasons for it?
	- What role does nostalgia play in it?
	- (for my examples) How does horror impact the previous answers?

## Married In Mount Airy



## AH - Skinamarink

Film emphasizes helplessness of being a child
- Not understanding the motivations of adults - Inscrutable entity and behaviour of parents
- Having a strange point of view - unusual camera angles
- Not being able to choose where to go
- Sounds coming from offscreen - reminds me of hearing parents arguing in the next room

The lack of resolution, clarity in Skinamarink lends it a dreamlike or ghostly quality
- Ghost elements, memory
	- visual and auditory noise makes things nondescript
	- Very specific but somewhat general elements pierce through the veil, the toys, the cartoons, the staircase
	- But other things seem to fade such as the faces or how the house seems unnaturally bare (Edward Ball mentions in an interview how stripping the house aided in setting ithe time period - Them article)
- Hazy dreamlike elements
	- editing
		- creates dreamlike sense of shifting geography/layout, never quite settled
		- Events don't always seem to follow each other clearly, non-sequiturs

This lack of clarity connects pretty clearly to the poor images essay, esp. section 4, as the dreamlike quality removes context and specificity, allowing others to project onto it.
However, the haunted aspects maintain a certain level of specificity that is still important for connection, the nostalgia aids here in the connection as well
Nostalgic specificity: house architecture, chatter phone, cartoons


Contains hauntological element of the collapsing of time
- The story is set in the 90's
	- The toys
	- The CRT TV
	- Text at start of movie
- 70's form elements
	- Film grain
	- Noise
	- Typeface
		- ITC Souvenir, very popular in the 70's
- 50's cartoons

The idea of Skinamarink seeming like some sort of found creepypasta **cursed** tape relates both to the idea that its imperfections lend it a certain materiality and also the idea that what it contains is stronger than the medium meant to contain it (Brian Eno)
Certainly, the material elements of the film make it look like it could be a degraded video someone just found somewhere
Paradoxically, the lack of this being a formal framing (such as with The Blair Witch Project) kind of enhances this sense? It's presented very plainly (also helpful that it has next to no credits) as nowadays that tactic comes off as more of a marketing tactic than anything else
It's difficult for me to find a lot of those Tik Toks so many articles mention, but Vulture article has a quote from Jane Schoenbrun about how it feels like early internet cursed videos
(not my observation, but) it's style of jumpscare is also reminiscent of viral internet jumpscares such as *The Ghost of Bongcheon-Dong, the car ad, the scary maze game, etc.
