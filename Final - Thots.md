# Final - Thots

## Questions
- What has driven this movement of artwork made with intentionally poor images?
	- What are the artistic purposes for it?
	- What are the techno-political reasons for it?
	- What role does nostalgia play in it?
	- (for my examples) How does horror impact the previous answers?
