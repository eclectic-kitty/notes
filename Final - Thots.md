# Final - Thots

## Questions
- What has driven this movement of artwork made with intentionally poor images?
	- What are the artistic purposes for it?
	- What are the techno-political reasons for it?
	- What role does nostalgia play in it?
	- (for my examples) How does horror impact the previous answers?

## Married In Mount Airy

## AH - Skinamarink

The idea of Skinamarink seeming like some sort of found creepypasta **cursed** tape relates both to the idea that its imperfections lend it a certain materiality and also the idea that what it contains is stronger than the medium meant to contain it (Brian Eno) (source for it being cursed or evil from Vulture article)
