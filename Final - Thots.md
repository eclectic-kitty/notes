# Final - Thots

## Alan Wake 2

### Thread 1: mediums
Alan Wake 2 presents different component mediums of videogames very clearly and separate from each other

#### Examples:
- Live action Dark Place scenes
- Alice's recordings for Alan
- Saga's telepathy
- Alan's writing
- Yoton Yo
- End-of-chapter songs
- Koskela commercials
- Night Springs episodes
- Alan writing scenes

#### Effects:
- Strengthens the game's surrealism
- Undermines & strengthens immersion
	- Reminds player of difference between game world and real world
	- At same time, makes characters seem more real
- Calls attention to fabricated nature of work

#### Class Concepts
- Ludology v. narratology
	- Strengthens importance of analysing game with different lenses (ludology for gameplay, narratology for plot, film studies for visual elements)
- identification
	- Could discourage identifying *as* characters, given that they are portrayed by real people,
	- Could encourage identifying with, as it lends depth to the characters

### Thread 2: rituals
Alan Wake 2 has the player/Saga & Alan perform various rituals throughout the game, featuring loops (spirals) as a core theme

#### examples
- overlap rituals
	- witch's heart
	- brother's murder
	- Tor's sons
- overlaps
	- Going through the same place multiple times
- Alan's murder scenes
	- Recreating the scenes
	- Meant to appeal to him, his ego
- Alan's loops
	- Waking up, talking to door
	- Enacting one of his murder scenes
	- Returning to the 
- Game itself
	- It's all a big ~~loop~~ spiral! Enacting the story Alan has written
	- Eventually leading to his ascension
	- While reinforcing itself
	- Gameplay loop of burning darkness before shooting

#### Thematic effects
- Relating the work of bettering one's self to rituals
	- Not a linear process, involves repetition
		- One *will* make mistakes, feel like they're restarting as they work on themselves
	- Appealing to a higher power?
		- One's self?
		- Or bettering yourself for the others around you?
		- Connection to programs like AA?
	- Difficult work
- Relating artistic work to rituals
	- Not a linear process, involves repetition
		- Creation is a constant process of editing, rewriting, starting over, whittling away, etc.
		- Interconnected with past and future
	- Appealing to a higher power
		- Appealing to an audience, their taste, their experiences
		- Appealing to Truth, Beauty
		- Appealing to ideals, emotions, etc.
	- Difficult work
	
#### Class concepts
- Performance theory
	- rituals
- Ludology
- Narratology
