# Final - Thots

## Outline

### Intro
Maybe something about being lost in the dark? A personal story about how I relate to Alan's struggle throughout the game to forgive himself and just *move on*.
Maybe something about how AW was a relatively simple game by comparison, how AWII has a surface level simplicity but rich symbolism in its depths that have connected so deeply with people such as myself?

#### Main Argument
Last out: Comparing the process of personal growth to a ritual illuminates the process of personal growth.
Prop: I will utilize close reading techniques, informed by performance theory, to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth in the 2023 survival horror videogame Alan Wake 2, developed by Remedy Entertainment.

I like the version from the proposal, I think I just need to (re-?)rephrase more directly, less proposal-y 
still love word choice with invoke and illuminate

In [...] Alan Wake II, ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth
for the purpose of?
the difficult process of personal growth?
the arduous process?

#### Denouement
Specifically, the comparison emphasizes  how the authority and constructed nature of rituals mirror similar qualities of self-image and how these can be utilized to change for the better.

### 1st section
Establishing key concepts and the validity of the comparison
mini-thesis: Alan's attempts to escape are ritualistic

#### Game?
General info on game and plot (Can probably just expand on the first paragraph of my proposal for this)
- Alan Wake, writer, trapped in a nightmare dimension, brings one's fears and imagination to life: especially if expressed as a creative work
	- Dark Place pulls from Alan's life, trapping him in a nightmare New York
	- Pages littered around the real world that narrate the game's events
	- When playing as Alan, we must solve puzzles by placing characters in scenes to change the level
- thus Alan tries to write a story that will allow him to escape, these involve ritualistic murders involving his own character, Alex Casey, looping structure,
- chased by Scratch? evil doppelganger, both literally and metaphorically represents his own worst impulses (might not wanna get into Scracth too much, saving for later paragraph about self-image)
	- the whole double thing isn't exactly subtle
	- in case one needed further proof, his endgame is apparently a world where everyone loves Alan and praises his book unconditionally
- 

Dual protagonist, Saga Anderson, foil to Alan, reconstructing stories instead of creating them, finds herself pulled into the story, investigating murders that echo those Alan has been writing, similarly out of her depth (lead detective for the first time!), but ultimately more confident, Daughter beginning to disappear

#### Rituals? (performance theory?)
Difference between rituals and other performance:
effectiveness vs. entertainment
Similarly, Alan is attempting to effect change via his writing, the literal change in the dreamspace around him metaphorically represents a change within his psyche as well, "ritual to lead you on", combatting Scratch, the Dark Place itself being made up of his fears ()

Specific type of ritual: liminal rituals
Focus on transforming someone
Extension of in-between
Dreams and nightmares being a kind of in-between space, imagery of water and reflections (prologue, lake, even the constant rain in the Dark Place and the tech involved)
Constant references to the hero's journey, which similarly focuses on this liminal space causing a transformation in the protagonist

### 2nd Section

#### Rituals' authority
Schechner, history
Alan making constant appeals to authority
