# Final - Thots

## Questions
- What has driven this movement of artwork made with intentionally poor images?
	- What are the artistic purposes for it?
	- What are the techno-political reasons for it?
	- What role does nostalgia play in it?
	- (for my examples) How does horror impact the previous answers?

## Married In Mount Airy

### Thematic analysis
Note: Ultimately, the details of what exactly the story is in MIMA is a little besides the point

Nevertheless, it all has an overarching theme of revealing the ugliness, the horrific in the romantic 

#### Story
The story revolves around a relationship (or two) between a woman and men that start out charming and sweet, but ultimately want to hurt and control the protagonist
(Comparison to Orpheus, so good at singing that he is able to charm even rocks, but who ultimately dies at the hands of women)
The album revolves around the narrator and her initially dreamy but doomed relationship with her partner, a man who proves to be manipulative and abusive and ultimately seems to kill her

#### Nostalgia
Which is indeed, how it engages with nostalgia,
Thematic connections to the album's namesake, Mount Airy Lodge
A honeymoon resort in the Poconos
The place where the album's narrator and her husband got married
Importantly, in the title track, the marriage and the descriptions of Mount Airy Lodge are in the past tense, a ghost
Even the sound of the song is ghostly, **degraded tape guitar**
The resort closed in 2003 after years of low attendance and ultimately demolished, like a lot of the other resorts in the area
Indeed, Nicole Dollanganger herself visited some of these abandoned resorts for photoshoots and a music video for her last album
Stereogum interview: "Everything is love-based, but it’s broken down and destroyed, which is one of the coolest paradoxes that you can find."
Capitalist (reference to famous ad) use of promises of picture-perfect love give way to the realities of rot 

#### return
However, the character simply can't stay away
Plenty of times, she expresses this explicitly
Potential interpretation of there being at least two men
Ultimately enamored by the gothic romance of mutual destruction (Nymphs - last verse)
In hauntological terms, narrator longs for this promised lost romantic future, both thte romance and the reality of her future death haunt her

#### Collapsing time (hauntology):
- married in the 60's,
- ad from the late 80's and onwards
- Title track in past tense, where rest in present tense
- Cyclical final track
- References her own death constantly
	- (tenuous) Gold Satin Dreamer - Tryna take you out of me is like, Tryna get smoke out of wood - kitchen tile cold on my cheek - I wait for it to get dark
	- Dogwood - You'll have to pry him from my cold dead grip
	- Runnin' Free - If I told him I’d die here if I stay 
	- My Darling True - Hold me 'till I'm cold and blue
	- Sometime After Midnight - And I’m watching the sky turn black By the window-side
- Sometime After Midnight's place in timeline tenuous

### Paratext

#### Imagery
While the record itself doesn't feature much formal degradation, aside from guitar on bookends,
Imagery released by Nicole with album feature a lot of degradation
- A lot of them look like old images, or images copied over and over again, ex. [this](./nicoleImages/brideColourFar.jpeg)
- Others, mainly single and cover art, look AI generated/edited, ex. [Gold Satin Dreamer single art](./nicoleImages/goldSatinDreamer.jpeg)
- Definite AI [animation](./nicoleImages/nicoleAnimation.GIF) on website home page

Hauntological formal element: time collapses in the techniques of the album's imagery

## AH - Skinamarink

Film emphasizes helplessness of being a child
- Not understanding the motivations of adults - Inscrutable entity and behaviour of parents
- Having a strange point of view - unusual camera angles
- Not being able to choose where to go
- Sounds coming from offscreen - reminds me of hearing parents arguing in the next room

The lack of resolution, clarity in Skinamarink lends it a dreamlike or ghostly quality
- Ghost elements, memory
	- visual and auditory noise makes things nondescript
	- Very specific but somewhat general elements pierce through the veil, the toys, the cartoons, the staircase
	- But other things seem to fade such as the faces or how the house seems unnaturally bare (Edward Ball mentions in an interview how stripping the house aided in setting ithe time period - Them article)
- Hazy dreamlike elements
	- editing
		- creates dreamlike sense of shifting geography/layout, never quite settled
		- Events don't always seem to follow each other clearly, non-sequiturs

This lack of clarity connects pretty clearly to the poor images essay, esp. section 4, as the dreamlike quality removes context and specificity, allowing others to project onto it.
However, the haunted aspects maintain a certain level of specificity that is still important for connection, the nostalgia aids here in the connection as well
Nostalgic specificity: house architecture, chatter phone, cartoons


Contains hauntological element of the collapsing of time
- The story is set in the 90's
	- The toys
	- The CRT TV
	- Text at start of movie
- 70's form elements
	- Film grain
	- Noise
	- Typeface
		- ITC Souvenir, very popular in the 70's
- 50's cartoons

The idea of Skinamarink seeming like some sort of found creepypasta **cursed** tape relates both to the idea that its imperfections lend it a certain materiality and also the idea that what it contains is stronger than the medium meant to contain it (Brian Eno)
Certainly, the material elements of the film make it look like it could be a degraded video someone just found somewhere
Paradoxically, the lack of this being a formal framing (such as with The Blair Witch Project) kind of enhances this sense? It's presented very plainly (also helpful that it has next to no credits) as nowadays that tactic comes off as more of a marketing tactic than anything else
It's difficult for me to find a lot of those Tik Toks so many articles mention, but Vulture article has a quote from Jane Schoenbrun about how it feels like early internet cursed videos
(not my observation, but) it's style of jumpscare is also reminiscent of viral internet jumpscares such as *The Ghost of Bongcheon-Dong, the car ad, the scary maze game, etc.
