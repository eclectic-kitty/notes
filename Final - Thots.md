- S3 - 350
- Concl. - 150
- Total: 1500

### Intro
Maybe something about being lost in the dark? A personal story about how I relate to Alan's struggle throughout the game to forgive himself and just *move on*.
Maybe something about how AW was a relatively simple game by comparison, how AWII has a surface level simplicity but rich symbolism in its depths that have connected so deeply with people such as myself?

#### Main Argument
Last out: Comparing the process of personal growth to a ritual illuminates the process of personal growth.
Prop: I will utilize close reading techniques, informed by performance theory, to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth in the 2023 survival horror videogame Alan Wake 2, developed by Remedy Entertainment.

I like the version from the proposal, I think I just need to (re-?)rephrase more directly, less proposal-y 
still love word choice with invoke and illuminate

In [...] Alan Wake II, ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth
for the purpose of?
the difficult process of personal growth?
the arduous process?

#### Denouement
Specifically, the comparison emphasizes  how the authority and constructed nature of rituals mirror similar qualities of self-image and how these can be utilized to change for the better.

### 1st section
Establishing key concepts and the validity of the comparison
mini-thesis: Alan's attempts to escape are ritualistic

#### Game?
General info on game and plot (Can probably just expand on the first paragraph of my proposal for this)
- Alan Wake, writer, trapped in a nightmare dimension, brings one's fears and imagination to life: especially if expressed as a creative work
	- Dark Place pulls from Alan's life, trapping him in a nightmare New York
	- Pages littered around the real world that narrate the game's events
	- When playing as Alan, we must solve puzzles by placing characters in scenes to change the level
- thus Alan tries to write a story that will allow him to escape, these involve ritualistic murders involving his own character, Alex Casey, looping structure,
- chased by Scratch? evil doppelganger, both literally and metaphorically represents his own worst impulses (might not wanna get into Scratch too much, saving for later paragraph about self-image)
	- the whole double thing isn't exactly subtle
	- in case one needed further proof, his endgame is apparently a world where everyone loves Alan and praises his book unconditionally
- 

Dual protagonist, Saga Anderson, foil to Alan, reconstructing stories instead of creating them, finds herself pulled into the story, investigating murders that echo those Alan has been writing, similarly out of her depth (lead detective for the first time!), but ultimately more confident, Daughter beginning to disappear

#### Rituals? (performance theory?)
Difference between rituals and other performance:
effectiveness vs. entertainment
Similarly, Alan is attempting to effect change via his writing, the literal change in the dreamspace around him metaphorically represents a change within his psyche as well, "ritual to lead you on", combatting Scratch, the Dark Place itself being made up of his fears ()

- What makes his writing analogous to a ritual?
- Effecting change = literally changing reality
- Manipulating the dark place can be seen as manipulating his psyche, his fears
- The stories he writes are themselves about rituals
	- "This is the ritual to lead you on"
	- Leading him on how? His character growth, his apotheosis
	- Destruction, darkness, liminality? Blank space for a new Alan?
- This personal transformation brings me to liminal rituals
- Transforming someone by bringing them into an in-between space
- Destruction, emptiness, darkness has to come before something new can be created
- Murder, 
- Hero's journey, leaving the comfortable, experiencing new things
- (if space)
- Pretty much all of human activity is a performance, including writing
- Why is Alan writing then a representation of ritual and not writing directly?
- break
- Repetition
- Performances all consist of restored behaviors
- Game has a lot of repetition


Specific type of ritual: liminal rituals
Focus on transforming someone
Extension of in-between
Dreams and nightmares being a kind of in-between space, imagery of water and reflections (prologue, lake, even the constant rain in the Dark Place and the tech involved)
Is water liminal? Is a reflection liminal? Am I getting a little mixed up?
Constant references to the hero's journey, which similarly focuses on this liminal space causing a transformation in the protagonist

### 2nd Section

#### Rituals' authority
Schechner, history
Alan making constant appeals to authority

## Quotes
- Performance Studies, an Introduction
	- Restored behaviours are "twice-behaved behaviours," behaviors behaved from the second to the nth time; never for the first time. 
		- pg. 10
	- Performances mark identities, bend time, reshape and adorn the body, and tell stories,
		- pg. 10
	- Restored behavior is "me behaving as if I were someone else," or "as I am told to do," or "as I have learned."
	- This broad spectrum of performing is a continuum, each category leading to, and blending into, the next.
		- pg. 76 
		- (Writing, being oneself, ritual-ing, all performances, we are interested in the contrast and what that tells us)
	- To “perform myself ” means to take on the appearance (clothes, demeanor, etc.), voice, and actions of Mother or Friend, Plumber or Doctor, and so on.
	- The more self-conscious a person is, the more one constructs behavior for those watching and/or listening, the more such behavior is “performing.” 
		- pg. 77 
		- (Alan is made aware of himself, his actions, his performances)
	- He wanted the performers to engage their roles actively, to enter into a dialectical relationship with the roles.
		- pg. 86
		- Alan encountering himself in his loops is like this, being placed outside himself in order to confront himself and better understand and critique himself
	- Brechtian performing interrogates the character’s actions, proposes alternative actions, and demystifies events that might otherwise appear to be “inevitable.”
		- pg. 89
	- Ritualists follow prescribed actions, wear designated costumes, and in other ways enact highly codified behaviors.
		- pg. 98
	- But in rituals the efficacy of the performance is paramount: what counts is what the performance accomplishes.
		- pg. 99
	- But the pomp and circumstance, the stuff of royal ritual, has a big effect on political and social life. The membrane separating what “appears” and what “is” is very thin and porous.
		- pg. 107
		- Talking about how performances effect reality and vice-versa, how one performs in everyday life
	- But in “real life” a person is simultaneously performing herself and being herself.
		- pg. 108
	- Only when saturated with the self-confidence resulting from the power of their own performing are they able to draw others into their magic circle
		- pg. 116
	- If someone obstinately and for a long time wants to appear something it is in the end hard for him to be anything else.
		- Nietzsche, quoted on pg. 116
	- On a more quotidian level, a person’s sense of self is very much tied to her ability to believe in the roles she plays. The matter is complicated because the roles are not played by a single, stable self. The self is created by the roles even as it plays them – a psychological mobius strip keeps turning outside into inside and inside into outside.
		- Pg. 118
	- Ritual not only communicates something but is taken by those performing it to
be 'doing something' as well
		- Rappaport, quoted on pg. 122
	- Rituals enhance clear communications because they are exaggerated, over­ determined, redundant, and repetitious. Ritual’s insistent metamessage is, 'You get the message, don’t you?!'
		- pg. 133
	- Everywhere rituals help people pass from one life stage to another – birth, puberty, marriage, parenting, social and professional advancement, retirement, and death
		- pg. 144
	- For Turner, the key phase is the liminal. A limen is a threshold or sill, neither inside nor outside a building or room linking one space to another, a passageway between places rather than a place in itself.
		- pg. 145
	- Conceptually, what happens within a liminal time–space is a reinforcement of culturally important matters.
		- pg. 145
	- Liminal entities are neither here nor there; they are betwixt and between the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention, and ceremonial. As such, their ambiguous and indeterminate attributes are expressed by a rich variety of symbols in the many societies that ritualize social and cultural transitions. Thus, liminality is frequently likened to death, to being in the womb, to invisibility, to darkness, to bi-sexuality, to the wilderness, and to an eclipse of the sun or moon.
		- Turner, quoted on pg. 145
	- Turner recognized in the liminal phase ritual’s ability to change social realities and to make new identities.Two things happen during the liminal phase: First, persons temporarily become “nothing.” [...] Second, during the liminal phase, per­sons are inscribed with their new identities, given new things to do, initiated into their new status.
		- pg. 145
		- Alan's repeated deaths are him becoming nothing, as is his possession by the darkness, the nothingness, him being shot with the bullet of light thus grants him his new purpose
	- The spaces of film, television, and computer monitors are more traditional. Apparently full of real things and people, they are actually empty screens, populated by shadows or pixels.
		- pg. 148
		- **This** is why all the meta stuff, In Between, the live action sequences, etc. work so well! It calls to attention the facade, the emptiness, the liminality of the Dark Place! The fact that it effects performance into reality, allows for transformation.
	- Liminal rituals are transformations, permanently changing who people are.
		- pg. 150
	- While performing, actors are not themselves, nor are they the characters. Theatrical role-playing takes place between “not me” and “not not me.”
		- pg. 151
	- If the performance’s purpose is to effect change, then the other qualities under the heading “efficacy” in figure 5.24 will also be present, and the performance is a ritual.
		- pg. 159
	- Efficacy and entertainment are not opposites, but “dancing partners,” each depending on and in continuous active relationship to the other.
		- pg. 159
	- Rituals provide stability. They also help people change from one status or identity to another.
		- pg. 160
	- They give the impression of permanence, of “always having been.” That is their publicly performed face. But only a little investigation shows that as social circumstances change, rituals also change.
		- pg. 160
	- Sometimes, changes are introduced to bring rituals into line with new social realities.
		- pg. 160
	- And if official rituals either do not satisfy or are egregiously exclusive, new rituals will be invented, or older rituals adapted, to meet felt needs.
		- pg. 160
- Performance Theory
	- Special rules exist, are formulated, and persist because these activities are something apart from everyday life. A special world is created where people can make the rules, rearrange time, assign value to things, and work for pleasure.
		- pg. 13
	- Thus their social function is to stand apart from ordinary life, both idealizing it (in these activities people play by the rules) and criticizing it (why can’t all life be a game?).
		- pg. 14
	- *Chart with source of rules*
		- pg. 17
	- One cannot discuss a single frame without referring to the others, because it is only within a pattern of relationships that a specific phenomenon takes place.
		- pg. 18
