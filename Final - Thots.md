# Final - Thots

## Potential vague ideas

- Alan Wake 2
	- Thread 1: mediums
		- Alan Wake 2 presents different component mediums of videogames very clearly and separate from each other
			- Examples:
				- Live action Dark Place scenes
				- Alice's recordings for Alan
				- Saga's telepathy
				- Alan's writing
				- Yoton Yo
				- End-of-chapter songs
				- Koskela commercials
				- Night Springs episodes
				- Alan writing scenes
		- Effects:
			- Strengthens the game's surrealism
			- Undermines & strengthens immersion
				- Reminds player of difference between game world and real world
				- At same time, makes characters seem more real
			- Calls attention to fabricated nature
		- Class Concepts
			- Ludology v. narratology
				- Strengthens importance of analysing game with different lenses (ludology for gameplay, narratology for plot, film studies for visual elements)
			- identification
				- Could discourage identifying *as* characters, given that they are portrayed by real people,
				- Could encourage identifying with, as it lends depth to the characters
	- Thread 2: rituals
		- Alan Wake 2 has the player/Saga & Alan perform various rituals throughout the game, featuring loops (spirals) as a core theme
			- examples
				- overlap rituals
					- witch's heart
					- brother's murder
					- Tor's sons
				- overlaps
					- Going through the same place multiple times
				- Alan's murder scenes
					- Recreating the scenes
					- Meant to appeal to him, his ego
				- Alan's loops
					- Waking up, talking to door
					- Enacting one of his murder scenes
					- Returning to the 
				- Game itself
					- It's all a big ~~loop~~ spiral! Enacting the story Alan has written
					- Eventually leading to his ascension
					- While reinforcing itself
					- Gameplay loop of burning darkness before shooting
		- Thematic effects
			- 
		- Class concepts
			- Performance theory
				- rituals
			- Ludology
			- Narratology
- Kentucky Route Zero
	- KRZ puts player in role of actor, playing and thus making interpretive choices about its characters
	- 
- Hollow Knight
- Life Is Strange
