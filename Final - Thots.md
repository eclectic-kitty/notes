# Final - Thots

## Outline

### Intro
Maybe something about being lost in the dark? A personal story about how I relate to Alan's struggle throughout the game to forgive himself and just *move on*.
Maybe something about how AW was a relatively simple game by comparison, how AWII has a surface level simplicity but rich symbolism in its depths that have connected so deeply with people such as myself?

#### Main Argument
Last out: Comparing the process of personal growth to a ritual illuminates the process of personal growth.
Prop: I will utilize close reading techniques, informed by performance theory, to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth in the 2023 survival horror videogame Alan Wake 2, developed by Remedy Entertainment.

I like the version from the proposal, I think I just need to (re-?)rephrase more directly, less proposal-y 
still love word choice with invoke and illuminate

In [...] Alan Wake II, ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth
for the purpose of?
the difficult process of personal growth?
the arduous process?
