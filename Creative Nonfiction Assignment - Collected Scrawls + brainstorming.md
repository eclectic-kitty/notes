# Creative Nonfiction Assignment - Collected Scrawls + brainstorming

## Writing
### First bit
I haven't heard from them in weeks. 
They haven't even opened our texts in five days.
And yet
The power they hold over me lingers. 
A spell cast in saliva and dead flowers.
Pushing me down as the minutes crawl by.
/ Grinding my skin into the road
My flesh making the asphalt sing

Pushing
Compressing me
Holding me (tight) (at a distance)
Bondage
Wrapped
Restrained
Leather

Their power over me lingers.
...
Holding me down...

### Clairvoyance
Oh! Clairvoyance!!! Timelines!!!
Tied to one or the other

Your spell whispers to me
Of a future in your arms /
I'm stuck running up an endless staircase /
It violently tears my body into another timeline
In your arms
Each one of my cells is superimposed
The wires cross
My bodies under your thrall won't listen

Swallow the key

### Bumble (waiting)
Even with people dming me on Bumble, I prefer holding onto the fantasy of you. By denying myself the love and attention I so desperately desire, I can reinforce the belief that I don't deserve it.

### Art & Names
Art-making is not creation out of nothing
Art-making is magic
Find the true names of things
Play tricks with them
Make them read as something they are not
At its most powerful,
It is transformation
It requires annihilation
Broken-down piecemeal, rearrange the characters
Combine them with the names of other things

Combine them with your own name
Pull that tooth
Tear out your liver

### Goodbye
13 sep. sunny, I have class, had ??? after. Didn't have time to ???

I talked to them outside a few hours ago. It felt
I remember kicking rocks while they talked. Something white and brittle. Chalky. Dragging them on ground.
It feels good now that I got it out.
I didn't think I'd cry so much.
It was hard to hear them say they really did mean what they said. Or that I had the right(?) to be mad at them. That they really did want this

I think the string was an important spell component.
Am I mourning a relationship that never was? A seance?
Carving the red into my thigh.

### Lyrics
"When she wants a garden, you give her a rose"
"Vampire in the corner, am I scaring you off?"
"I wanna make you mine / Told you a thousand times / I'm your valentine"

"You made a holy fool of me and I've thanked you ever since" - revisionary
"Well, so many nights I drank myself to the bottom of a heart" - revisionary
"There's a light that's going out tonight / And it ain't gonna come back on" - revisionary

### Bed (third date)
Lying in my bed, your face inches away from mine, I wondered if I should kiss you. The first of many on those pink sheets. But I didn't, and the spell dissipated with the memories -that never came-
The "beer" fed the embers in...
A warmth rose in my belly from the ginger beer you'd brought me. The flowers on the kitchen table and your cheeks made my head swim in blood.
It's more and more difficult to access that exact power. I can only faintly remember the way it made my bones sing.
My bones can't seem to find the notes anymore.

### Ghost
I did everything right! I followed your wishes to the letter. I went above and beyond to make sure you couldn't return. I made sure they buried you in the brown flannel you loved so much. In a concrete vault. I ringed our house in salt and covered all the mirrors, but I can feel you crossing over. I moved all your things to the basement but I can see the places where your armoire gouged into the wood. I keep finding the bracelet you spun back on my nightstand. The iron gate unlocked. I don't remember writing about you in my dream journal, but it's my handwriting. I refuse to say your name. I won't. I won't. I won't.

### After (Waiting?)
Even as I stop thinking about you as much, the craters in my mouth root me to the spot.

Luka asked if we could stand outside on the balcony before we went to sleep today. I brought Neko out with us. My foot hesitated before landing on the rough dusty ground 3 stories up. Luka, as little ones do, charged on. We looked at the stars and I taught him how to clap with cupped hands to maximise the sharp reflection from the building ahead.
Neko said that "[she wants] the pharaohs / But there's only men" and I felt the thinning yarn on my wrist again. I remember watching you ask Luka for his name still raw in the center. Is mine finished baking? If questioned would you be able to describe what my name tastes like? I wish you had thrust your sword into me despite failing to answer my riddle as I don't think I'll ever hit the ground. "This all was only wishfull thinking."
///
what it will taste like?

### Writing
Maybe in writing all this down, I can redirect the spell onto the page. Embed it in the fibers in plum. I think you would have liked this pen. I don't believe I'll ever be strong enough to resist you, but perhaps in naming this feeling / your spell, I can learn to manipulate it myself. Soft dough between my fingers, stinging and mixing with my blood, filling up the ridges between my fingertips.

How do I give you a voice in all this? How do I illuminate / reveal / spotlight / my delusions / fixations / reveries like trees against the night sky. My desire to be spellbound, to have an excuse for my actions.

"So let's just pretend / Everything and anything / Between you and me / Was never meant"
Did you mean to do this to cast this spell? Is it only "wishful thinking?" Can I take you at your word? When is so many others have spoken similar illusions in an attempt to protect me. When the you in my mind fits that mold so well.

### Car (3d Date)
"I've wanted to do that since our first date"
"What do you think we should be doing?"
I looked away because I wasn't even sure if I wanted to kiss you. The car was cooked and I was anxious I was blocking the way. I wasn't sure how much I liked you yet.
But you kissed me again. And I watched you retreat into your home, wondering what your living room looked like from the other side of the window. You left me with such few signs of your presence, The way you smelled on my pillow and the Winnie the Pooh I've had all my life.

### Goodbye (Writing)
Are my doubts because I can't believe someone would really like me? Sitting on the sidewalk, my knees at a weird angle with the phone held away so you wou;dn't hear my sobs. Another boundary, intangible. Or maybe it's easier to pretend I'm fantasizing rather than eulogizing. Once again I'm denying your spell rather than redirecting it.

## What are the ideas I'm exploring?
My experience of *romantic interest* being like being under someone's spell,
*obsession, anxiety, compulsion*
I am so easy to fall for people and I will put *so much energy* into these infatuations

The other person being almost *incidental*
I'll fall for just about anyone who shows me a *crumb of attention*
Ultimately, this *spell* is wishful thinking on my part
I want to believe the other person wants me back
(I want to be wanted so badly someone would pour that energy into me)
But it's a ~~self-fulfilling prophecy~~
Ultimately it is I who is pouring all this energy

I need protection from them (myself)
So I cast my own spells
I write it down
I try to name these feelings

Ultimately perpetuating the cycle?
