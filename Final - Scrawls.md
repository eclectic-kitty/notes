# Final - Scrawls

### Meeting
It's a quiet night. It's been a couple of hours now. I'm watching a fly repeatedly bump into the grimy window. The bartender wipes the same cup again she's already wiped at least twice. The alcohol I've had to sip to keep her from glaring at me isn't helping the empty in my gut. I tried eating one of the peanuts on the bar but it too only added to the empty.

The bell on the door rings. I turn, and for a moment, it feels like the empty will swallow up the rest of my flesh. She's dressed in a thigh-length pink skirt, with a matching crop top. Her cheeks is flushed from cheap booze and I can just taste the rich iron on my tongue. After hauling her friends over the threshold, the richest brown eyes I've ever seen scan the room once over, then back, and stare into mine for a moment.

"C'mon guys! It doesn't look that bad in here. Worst case scenario, Sam, you can just get something in a bottle or whatever."

"Laura—"

"Shh, at least one drink! The night is young!"

The girls settle into a table by the corner and I try my best not to stare too much. Somehow, this is worse than having the bar empty. Laura smells of marzipan and her laugh makes the room so much warmer. But, I can't do anything while her friends are here. And then she turns to look at me again and I have to dig my nails into my thigh. Before too long though, most of her friends filter out, leaving her with just one other friend, still trying to convince her to leave.

"Laura, I can't leave you alone, let's go home. You had your chance to talk to her."

"Oh, hey, I was going to stay a bit longer anyway. I can make sure she gets home."

I see Laura's friend look me up and down for a moment.

"See, it's fine! She— What's your name?" Laura asks.

"Vic. You're Laura, right?"

"Yep! Anyway, Vic here'll take care of me." She then leans in and whispers entirely audibly, "Also she's so hot, please, Sam. Look at that leather jacket!"

"Laura—"

"Don't worry, I'll keep her safe," I say, staring deep into Sam's eyes with a smile.

"Safe... Yeah, okay."

"Awesome, thanks Sam, I'll see you soon, love you, bye!" Laura says, pretty much shoving her away. "Alright, so, Vic right?" she says, before turning back to me. 

### Finding out / negotiation?
"Vic, I know."

Her voice is the only sound in the world.

"Well, fuck."

I don't say anything. I can't meet her gaze. I watch the snowflakes twirl through the air, white against the mist.

"Girl, you work night shifts as a security guard, you had no food in your fridge the first night I came over, and we've literally never seen each other in the sun. To be honest, I'm surprised it took me as long as it did." 

"Well yeah, if you put it that way. I mean, it's not like you see much sunlight either," I smirk at her and she rolls her eyes.

She looks so warm. 

"I... Please don't think I'd ever hurt you."

"Vic... Of course. I know you would never hurt me. Not in any way I wouldn't want, at least," she says, winking

"Honey, I'm serious."

"I... I am too."

I can smell her beginning to sweat under her coat.

"Oh. Okay. I—"

"I was thinking maybe you could, you know, bite me."

I can't help but stare at her neck. Her skin is so flushed with the cold. 

"Yeah, I got that, Laura. I don't know. It feels dangerous, I can't risk losing control."

"I mean, it's not like I would complain..." 

I can hear her heart. For a moment her eyes look green.

"Baby."

"Ok, yeah, I know what you mean. Listen, how about we come up with a safeword or something like that?" 

"Alright, I think that could work."

"Perfe—"

"You have to promise me though. You have to promise you'll stop me, even if it means slapping me or something like that."

"I promise."

I stare deep into her eyes, such a deep brown against the snow and mist. I put my hand on her thigh and it's not long before we're kissing, her warm against my cold lips.

### I want to save the stronger conflict for the ending argument I think...

"Vic, I know you, you won't."

"You don't know what it's like."

"And I don't think you're being fair with yourself, you're always feeling guilty over nothing!"

"Laura, I've killed someone."

"Yeah, I figured. Look, I can just tell from "
