	- (I do think everyone's cute tho tbf)
	- (I'm a little gay slut ðŸ˜”)

I don't know where the emphasis goes in Shakespeare and I'm salty about it
Oh rip iambic pentameter

I'm truly devastated I missed the death as sex talk
It's a big death

I feel like I wanna go on Tumblr to find stuff for my moodboard but am scared of opening my Tumblr in class

What time does ur next class start at btw?
But what time does it start
My brain ignored the 6 as if it were like part of a numbered list
# Is this better
# Oops all headers
# for EVER?
# That's so long ðŸ˜­
# Cat?
# Mrow
# Miaou
# Starkid???
# oh yeaaaaaah
# One of my little transmasc besties ranted to me about it at a shabbat dinner recently
# I have like three lol
# I will not choose a fave transmasc bestie
# Colin is also at Concordia now technically
# lmao ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
# poor lil' Matt
## To be fair we haven't hung out in ages
## Friday???
## Ruh roh, I have a concert
## I bought this ticket months ago ðŸ˜­
## Also he never put me in the group chat
## I haven't gone on discord in like a month
## What time does it start???
## My concert is at 7:30
## Also I kinda wanted to go to this rave/sex party afterwards
## But I was admittedly not sure
## I would go to Matt's party if y'all will still be around at like 11
## End times are p much never published
## But generally concerts end at like 10:30 - 11
## Let's just crash at Matt's
## ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
## But bestieeeeeeieeee <33333333
## my guy, anytime
## I couldn't go Tuesday cuz... I can't remember
## Oh yeah! I had to make din-din
## Just come see this band with me instead, tix are 30$
## I already have tix tho ðŸ˜¿ðŸ˜¿ðŸ˜¿
## also nobody checked with me before saying I was coming ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
## I want someone to come back to bed with me ðŸ˜¿
## I'm v cuddly!!!
## He's all lanky I'm squishy
###### We do stan Dashiell tho <3

## Me trying to organize a date with Brooke for like a month ðŸ˜¿ðŸ˜¿ðŸ˜¿
## She's allegedly busy!!!
## She was maybe gonna go to the sex party with me but then it turned out it was 21+
## And then I asked about hanging out next week and she said she was v behind on school
## And I'm just like u were gonna go to an all night rave but going to a movie is too much??? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
## I dunnoooooooo, she also claims she doesn't like making long-term plans
## She did say she'd be down to study together next week tho
## Oh yah I'm like what is going onnnnnnnnnn
## I haven't asked cuz I don't wanna come off as insecure/needy but I am like a piece of straw away from asking straight up if she's still interested or not
## I haven't talked to other peeps in person that much other than like the butch trans girl who was just drunk
## Also apparently Chloe went on a date and I was all ðŸ˜­ for a moment about it
