# Assignment - Why Write

To give shape to what I feel, exorcise it from my mind so it can live independently of me.

I remember so many lunchtimes spent in the staircase in my high school. I dreaded every single time I would hear the door open while simultaneously trying to will messages from friends to appear on my phone. While the extremes of my teenage years have softened somewhat, it's still moments like these I think that most push me to be creative. Moments when my mind and soul are full to bursting (heavy) with feeling that threatens to make me pop(!) I want so desperately to [...] Allow the feeling to expand and fill the empty staircase. Stop flinching at the sound of the push bar. Allow others in to hold the feeling, turn it over in their hands and understand this little piece of my self, and maybe theirs too. *A True Magic Trick*. Sometimes I worry that it feels very self-centered, but I hope that in naming these pieces of my self/soul/brain/insides, others can recognize these pieces in themselves and others. *Contradictions*. I went to the staircases because they were the emptiest places in the school (near my classes). And yet, I went there precisely because I couldn't stand to be alone. I hope I can give others the power I wish I could give that girl bleeding alone on the steps. The power Julien and Kevin and XXXXX gave me. The power to rename their blood and bruises and grey matter. It's a power I lack so often these days, unable to find the names without overflowing again.
