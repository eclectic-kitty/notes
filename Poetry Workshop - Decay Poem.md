# Poetry Workshop - Decay Poem

the air is thick with sugar and oxygen
my thighs push through iron pitch as
shingles flow off brick in row after row after row

a strangling scent
slices cell walls
smashing atoms

flies land in eyes, mouths, wounds, 
joining those soaked in rushing nectar
mycelium and microbes

breathing out that stench
that will soon burst like a razor
floating up past lace skin



that sloughs off my calf
tangling in the spokes
soaking wells of honeyed blood

into asphalt bending space-time
threatening
to pull my image like taffy

but the rest cycles past
blowing aside flies as
chlorophyll drips

smell and orange bloom
rain and musk that drifts off earth
beneath her window on Dézéry

inside lies a bathtub bursting with offal
swiss army knife in my hand, ripping and tearing 
past liquid heart, prostate, appendix



offered to blooming carrion
flowers from the molding mess
the rest for the maggots

infested with roots glistening
I tear out and offer to bloom

the molding iron blisters still
my knees, my skull, my tongue
all fibers contracting despite me

I know I should drain the tub and pull them out but
my legs keep cycling, orange seeps in
so I merely drape a sheet over them

the memory is already clotted and scarring
as I ride the wind turns
and leaves fall over the scarred streets

tangling in my hair and flesh
smothered in tannins
I strip my projection and sink into



the bed covering in white moss
posts rise from peat while a starless sky blankets
so many skins and deaths

suspended in acid guilt
staining the sheets
and cracking the lock around jasmine’s neck,

a millstone around mine,
cradling me down into
the mattress

warm



cuts



haunt



__
shreds the flesh
lingering on with only spite
to my calves

tightening its grip on
the glow in the well
in each of my veins
__
cast in earthen honey light
flowing into my lungs
fibers strain to stretch and rise above ground
poisoned by the pitch flowing
from houses in endless mitosis

a strangling scent thunders
butchers and demolishes cell walls
to forge stars for feasting
__
syrupy earthen light flows
	down stars and highways
		diffusing floral oxygen
__
inside lies a bathtub bursting with offal
swiss army knife in my hand, ripping and tearing 
past liquid heart, prostate, appendix

offered to blooming carrion
flowers from the molding mess
the rest for the maggots
