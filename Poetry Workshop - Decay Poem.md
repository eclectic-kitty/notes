# Poetry Workshop - Decay Poem

title: unrotting

air thick with sugar and oxygen
meanders along wide streets and through
fruit, dripping

on ash pitch flowing from
shingles melting off brick 
in row past row past row

my thighs push
through the haze
when

a strangling scent
slices cell walls
dissolving molecules

flies land in eyes, mouths, wounds, 
joining those soaked in rushing nectar
mycelium, microbes

breathe out stench
that bursts like a razor
floating up past lace skin

that sloughs off
my calf, tangling in the spokes, spraying
wells of honeyed blood into asphalt

but the rest cycles past
blowing aside flies
chlorophyll fades in sun

brown and orange blooming
rain and musk that drift off fallen leaves
beneath her window on dézéry, where

inside lies a bathtub bursting with offal
swiss army blade in my hand, ripping and tearing 
past solar heart and prostate, appendix

all cast aside disgracefully
submerged in prescriptivist rage
superimposing caustic film

a divine punishment inflicted
my calf & thigh, tongue
all fibers contracting despite me, locked

eventually, the waves still as 
muscles ease, climbing out,
thighs push through

cuts, tannins,
three inches
piled high, my

bones sink down
from clouds, white
moss blankets

a bed, posts
mired in peat,
so many skins and deaths

preserved in faithless shame
stain the sheets and split open
the freezing lock around jasmine’s neck,

a millstone around mine,
cradling me down into 

      the mattress

lingering on with only spite
to my calves

poisoned by the pitch flowing
from houses in endless mitosis

butchers and demolishes cell walls

in a flash
stinging seeps into
legs that keep pushing through

nettles, cuts,
as I ride the wind turns
and leaves fall over the scarred streets

tangling in my hair and flesh
smothered in tannins
I strip my projection and sink into

into asphalt bending space-time
threatening
to pull my image like taffy


Make end more wintery
Alternate ending?
Dig down into *guilt*
why?
Make (false?) ending more negative
Focus on imagery to return, what is most important?
Is the narrative clear? Where could I be a little less opaque?
	What are meant to be the takeaways from each section?
	From the poem as a whole?
How do I ground the reader?
Highlight bits where maybe the 3 syllable thing is hindering
