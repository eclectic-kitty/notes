# Poetry Workshop - Decay Poem

air thick with sugar and oxygen
meanders along wide streets and through
fruit, dripping

on ash pitch flowing from
shingles melting off brick 
in row past row past row

pass by idly
thighs push through
when

a strangling scent
slices cell walls
dissolving molecules

flies land in eyes, mouths, wounds, 
joining those soaked in rushing nectar
mycelium and microbes

breathing out that stench
that will soon burst like a razor
floating up past lace skin

that sloughs off my calf
tangling in the spokes
soaking wells of honeyed blood

into asphalt bending space-time
threatening
to pull my image like taffy

but the rest cycles past
blowing aside flies as
chlorophyll drips

smell and orange bloom
rain and musk that drift off fallen leaves
beneath her window on dézéry

inside lies a bathtub bursting with offal
swiss army blade in my hand, ripping and tearing 
past solar heart, prostate, appendix

cast aside disgracefully
submerged in prescriptivist rage
superimposing caustic film

bubbles, blisters still the glow 
my calf, my thigh, my tongue
all fibers contracting despite me, locked

eventually, the waves still as 
muscles ease, climbing out,
thighs push through

cuts, tannins
three inches
piled high on asphalt

drifting down
from clouds, white
moss blankets

a bed, posts
that rise from peat
so many skins and deaths

frozen in numb guilt
stain the sheets and crack 
the lock around jasmine’s neck,

a millstone around mine,
cradling me down into 

	the mattress,




warm








/// Perhaps better saved for later, for decomposition
offered to blooming carrion
flowers from the molding mess
the rest for the maggots

__
shreds the flesh
lingering on with only spite
to my calves

tightening its grip on
the glow in the well
in each of my veins
__
cast in earthen honey light
flowing into my lungs
fibers strain to stretch and rise above ground
poisoned by the pitch flowing
from houses in endless mitosis

a strangling scent thunders
butchers and demolishes cell walls
to forge stars for feasting
__
syrupy earthen light flows
	down stars and highways
		diffusing floral oxygen
__
inside lies a bathtub bursting with offal
swiss army knife in my hand, ripping and tearing 
past liquid heart, prostate, appendix

offered to blooming carrion
flowers from the molding mess
the rest for the maggots

__
in a flash
stinging seeps into
legs that keep pushing through

nettles, cuts,
as I ride the wind turns
and leaves fall over the scarred streets

tangling in my hair and flesh
smothered in tannins
I strip my projection and sink into
