# Poetry Workshop - Decay Poem

air thick with sugar and oxygen
meanders along wide streets and through
fruit, dripping

on ash pitch flowing from
shingles melting off brick 
in row past row past row

my thighs push
through the haze
when

a strangling scent
slices cell walls
dissolving molecules

flies land in eyes, mouths, wounds, 
joining those soaked in rushing nectar
mycelium, microbes

*5*  breathing out that stench
*8* that will soon burst like a razor
floating up past lace skin

*5* that sloughs off my calf
*5* tangling in the spokes
*7* soaking wells of honeyed blood

into asphalt bending space-time //
threatening //
*8* to pull my image like taffy //
// This doesn't make sense here anymore, would be better served in the other ending
could use the extra two syllables from asphalt

// Also this stuff later could probably be a bit more stilted, short, enjambed, but not as much as winter stuff

but the rest cycles past
blowing aside flies as
*4* chlorophyll drips // other word than drips

*5* smell and orange bloom
rain and musk that drift off fallen leaves
*7* beneath her window on dézéry

*11* inside lies a bathtub bursting with offal
swiss army blade in my hand, ripping and tearing 
past solar heart, prostate, appendix

*7* cast aside disgracefully
*8* submerged in prescriptivist rage
*8* superimposing caustic film

*7* bubbles, blisters still the glow 
my calf, my thigh, my tongue
*10* all fibers contracting despite me, locked

eventually, the waves still as 
muscles ease, climbing out,
thighs push through

cuts, tannins,
three inches
piled high, my

bones sink down
from clouds, white
moss blankets

a bed, posts
mired in peat,
so many skins and deaths

preserved in faithless shame
stain the sheets and split open
the freezing lock around jasmine’s neck,

a millstone around mine,
cradling me down into 

	the mattress,




warm






forever / unrotting / embalmed

a mummy, a fossil, out of time, a ghost, a relic, a







/// Perhaps better saved for later, for decomposition
offered to blooming carrion
flowers from the molding mess
the rest for the maggots

__
shreds the flesh
lingering on with only spite
to my calves

tightening its grip on
the glow in the well
in each of my veins
__
cast in earthen honey light
flowing into my lungs
fibers strain to stretch and rise above ground
poisoned by the pitch flowing
from houses in endless mitosis

a strangling scent thunders
butchers and demolishes cell walls
to forge stars for feasting
__
syrupy earthen light flows
	down stars and highways
		diffusing floral oxygen
__
inside lies a bathtub bursting with offal
swiss army knife in my hand, ripping and tearing 
past liquid heart, prostate, appendix

offered to blooming carrion
flowers from the molding mess
the rest for the maggots

__
in a flash
stinging seeps into
legs that keep pushing through

nettles, cuts,
as I ride the wind turns
and leaves fall over the scarred streets

tangling in my hair and flesh
smothered in tannins
I strip my projection and sink into


Make end more wintery
Alternate ending?
Dig down into *guilt*
why?
Make (false?) ending more negative
Focus on imagery to return, what is most important?
Is the narrative clear? Where could I be a little less opaque?
	What are meant to be the takeaways from each section?
	From the poem as a whole?
How do I ground the reader?
Highlight bits where maybe the 3 syllable thing is hindering
