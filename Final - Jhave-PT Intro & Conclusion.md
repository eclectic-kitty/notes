# Final - Jhave-PT Intro & Conclusion

This essay explores intentional degradation and symbolic looking -backward in Nicole Dollanganger’s 2023 album Married In Mount Airy, which utilizes nostalgia in a very complex paradoxical horror about dead things in order to examine the simultaneity of attraction and repulsion. Abusive relationships and love twisted by organizations (platforms, ideologies) with ulterior motives. Ghosts are important: in Julie Kristeva’s Power of Horror, notions of abjection evolves in conjunction with disgust and desire which reminds us of the material nature of this media. So the main element of new media here is the degradation which ties into rot and nostalgic haunting. 

This movement toward degradation runs contrary and parallel to a contemporary general desire for nostalgia in mass media. Nostalgia that familiarizes and commodifies relates to the resort and the abusive honeymoon husband. It is far more interesting and valuable to have this version of nostalgic art which looks at the past but doesn’t try to sugar coat over the decay but engages with why we find it so attractive. INSERT A FINAL SENTENCE THAT SUMS UP WHAT HAUNTING IS ABOUT AND ITS RELEVANCE TO NEW MEDIA. Hito Styerly’s paratextual commentaries on poor images and their spread which enables visual bonds can also offer insight into Nicole Dollanganger’s popular presence on Tumblr which is evoked through gore, blood, and nostalgia.
