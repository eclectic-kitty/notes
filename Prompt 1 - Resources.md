Prompt 1 - Resources

Since about high school, music has been one of the most important things in my life and one of the parts of my life that has brought me the most comfort. It helps me feel my way through the world. I turn to it in order to connect with my emotions, marvel at its beauty, experience community and so much more. For this prompt, I decided to share a couple of songs that are not necessarily my favourites (if there is such a thing), but that I find particularly comforting and help me make sense of things.

Sparklehorse - More Yellow Birds


The Mountain Goats - The Best Ever Death Metal Band Out of Denton
I wanted to share this song because it speaks to a deep insecurity I have, and one that I'm sure many of my classmates, as fellow artists, share. What if I don't "make it"? I love art and I want to, need to make art so badly because I want nothing more than to connect with others around me. I want to share myself and allow others to see me and in seeing me see themselves. But for this, my work needs to be seen in the first place. What happens when I pour my life into learning to make art only for it to be drowned under the vast seas of art that pours out of so many of us? What if the right Audience never finds my work?

This song addresses this fear head-on, telling the story of the titular band: two boys named Cyrus and Jeff who never played a single gig, never recorded music, in fact never got past practicing in their bedrooms. Their dreams of "stage lights and Lear jets" are cut short when Cyrus' parents send him to a boarding school after finding pentagrams stenciled on his instrument. Cyrus and Jeff never even name their band.

However, the song's tone is far from one of defeat. Consisting only of an acoustic guitar and vocals, the song is ferocious as the lead singer tears into the guitar strings. Instead, he proclaims that the band will "both outpace and outlive you." before throwing in some 'hail satan's for good measure. The scale of Jeff and Cyrus' art is reframed. They were maybe never the best ever death metal band, but they were the best ever death metal band out of **Denton**. 

Ultimately the song says that it doesn't matter how many people see your work, how successful you are. AS long as it matters to you, it has value. I don't know if I'll be able to make a living from art, but I'll never stop making it.
