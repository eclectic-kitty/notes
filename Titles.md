# Titles
What are three titles that youâ€™ve found memorable over time? These titles can be taken from an article, a book, a performance, an artwork, etc. Now, imagine that each of these titles could be a model for your own title for your final project. Using your favourite titles as guides, write down three possible titles for your final project and include them beside the titles that have inspired you.

 - Annihilation
	- I love the contradictions in this title. It's very simple, only one single word, but it's a harsh and relatively complicated word.
	- 
 - Hours Were the Birds
	- I love the word play in this title made up of very simple words, the double meaning of "hours/ours".
 - Fox Confessor Brings the Flood
	- I kind of love that I don't know what this could mean, but that the three words are so evocative, regardless.
