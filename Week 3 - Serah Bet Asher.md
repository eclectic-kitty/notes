# Week 3 - Serah Bet Asher
Hard "h"!!!
Jacob's granddaughter, Asher's daughter

## Mentions
Why is she named?
Jacob's other granddaughters aren't named
Nothing else is said about her
Just mentioned, and that she is either the daughter of Asher, or the sister of her brothers

Mentioned in three genealogies
- Genesis
- Numbers
- Chronicles

## Comparisons w/ other women
Never referred to as being the wife or mother of someone else, just daughter and sister

In other cases, such as Miriam, the rabbis don't love the lack of a marital status

Also like Jephtha, important aspect of her is forgotten (in this case, actions)

## Midrash
In absence of other information, rabbis create three legends, midrash about her
One of the only people in the bible said to be immortal, and this is something the rabbis add
Some other people die in special ways, but Serah is never said to have died
They also don't seem to bother with her name

### Ex. w/ Joseph
Jealous over Joseph, his brothers get him enslaved by the Egyptians
For years, as Joseph is enslaved, in Egypt for many years, Jacob believes he is dead, he's distraught
Drought arrives, Jacob sends his sons to get food, end up getting food from Joseph wihtout realizing it's him

Here is where the rabbis plug Serah in
Joseph's brothers don't want to tell Jacob as they fear him not believing them, dying, etc.
For some reason, they decided that she is a musician
Thus, she is able to softly present Jacob with this new information

#### Music
Women being able to sing or speak is an issue!
Rabbis making her thing singing and playing music 

### In Persia,
Tomb/room for her
Appear in rather Traditions

She is referred to by the rabbis as entering the garden of eden
long after the others
