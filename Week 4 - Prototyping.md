# Week 4 - Prototyping

## Problem space
- Bounded
- Conceptual
- Multidimensional
- Solution exists within
- Prototypes are points within the space
- Red room, multidimensional

## Prototypes
### Definitions?
- Representations of a diesign idea, any medium
- Materials
- tools
	- Traversing, exploring a design space

### What is prototyping
- Making and utilizing prototypes
- You don't want to make just one, not the final version
- Repeatedly trying ideas, getting feedback
- Sitting back afterwards and reflecting

### Why do we prototype?
- Impossible to fully explain what you mean
- Can help communicate the idea, even to yourself
- "So that the world can speak back to us"
- Answer, find questions
- Saving time and money!

### States of mind

#### Inventor
Having lots of vaired ideas, putting them out there

#### Scientist
What am I focusing on?
Specifics

#### Game jammer
Doing what you need to do to make it work
Cutting corners if you have to

#### The Detacher
Often, prototypes tell you as much about what *doesn't* work than what does
Need to be willing to walk away

#### The T1000 (Dory?)
Just keep swimming
ROlling with the punches

### Fidelity
Often comes up in comparisons, high vs low fidelity
Prototyping often involves low-fidelity approaches
Consider pros and cons of high vs low fidelity prototypes
- Cost
- Might make users giving feedback think it's done and there's no point in suggesting changes

### Categorising
Paying attention to 3 aspects
- Fidelity
	- closeness to eventual design
- Resolution
	- amount of detail
- Purpose
	- role
	- look and feel
	- implementation
		- Js? Python? means
	- integration
		- Bringing multiple ones together as one

### Anatomy of a prototype
**Filtering**:
- Zoom in on aspects and questions to focus on
- Screen out unnecessary aspects of the design that a prototype doesn't need to explore

**Dimensions**
- Materials
	- consequences of materials?
- Resolution of details
- Scope
	- How much of the design idea is being considered

**Economic principle**
In the simplest and most efficient way, makes the possibilities and limitations of a design idea visible and measurable

Keep design hypotheses in mind as you go,
State them, make them clear to yourself

### Strategies?
Prototype one idea and refine?
Prototype multiple ideas?
When should you share?
Will they be influenced by groupthink?

#### Testing
- Hyypotheses
	- Creating and viewing multiple prototypes leads to more individual dessign exploration
	- SHaring multiple prototypes leads to more productive dialogue and better group rapport
		- Nobody ended up that attached to an  particular idea
		- Everyone was optimistic, would like at least some aspects of the various prototypes
		- Everyone is making themselves vulnerable
	- Sharing multiple prototypes leads to more conceptual blending
		- Groupthink doesn't really happen
		- Everyone starts with different ideas
		- You get something new from combining ideas!
	- Sharing multiple prototypes produces better design results
- All proved correct

### Sketching
Subset of prototyping - Bill Buxton
- Quick
- Timely
- Inexpensive
- Disposable
- Plentiful
- Clear vocabulary
- Distinct gesture
	- openness? freedom?
- Minimmal detail
	- only what is required
- Appropriate degree of refinement
- Suggest and explore rather than confirm
- Ambiguity

#### Differences
- Evocative vs didactive
- Suggestive vs descriptive

## Video Prototypes
- Conveying context of use, interactions, and functionalioty
	- What can it do?
- Employs narrative
	- Borrowing from other video media
- Design idea conveyed exist anywhere along continuum of concept to functioning prototype

### Advantages
- Cheap and fast to produce
- Zwinderman et al's research: remarkably expressive considering product doesn't exist
- Practically same insights as a user test with an actual product
- good for overall, not for very specific 

### Science fiction prototypes
Seeking a productive middle ground between fact and fiction
New lens, viewing emerging theories differently
Prototypes similar to science fiction

#### 5 steps
Select a technology
Introduce the scientific inflection point
Explore the implications and ramificaions for th eworld
...

#### Micro SFP
- Micro-fictions are stories that are between 6 - 1000 words long
- Popularity is approximately inverse to the size
- Common: 25-30 words (Tweet)
- Toold for describing innovative product prototypes
- Doing more with less! Efficient! Only what's necessary to test idea

### Video prototyping toolkit
- Actors
- Cinematography and editing
- SF tropes
- Lo-fi mockups, sketches
- Stop motion
- Post production
