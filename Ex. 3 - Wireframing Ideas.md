# Ex. 3 - Wireframing Ideas

## Affordance words
request, demand, encourage, discourage, refuse, and allow

## Section organisation
### Home / Discovery
- Placement
	- Don't like that suggested content is such a big focus, so much so it's the "home"
- \ Would rename Discovery
- Only tiny section for what I've been listening to 
	- not even direct, some algorithmic meddling
	- Also similar sections in library, and an additional mobile-only interface
### Library
- Placement
	- Only in sidebar
		- search/home always visible
	- \ Would make tab again
- Sections
	- Playlists & Podcasts before anything else
	- No songs section
	- \ Would make songs section
	- \ Would get rid of playlists section
- Sort by
	- Separate button
	- table only like half implemented
	- Data?
		- No date released
		- Played last so there
		- \ Would make it editable, make artist inline
	- \ Would make it toggles from top

## Sidebar
### Queue
- Overcomplicated
	- queue + playing from section
- Only available full screen
	- More difficult to add thigns on the fly, to know what's coming up
- Separate tabs for what came before?
### Playlists
- Would allow to filter by

## Podcasts
- Nein ‚ùå
	- Yeet
		- Refuse
- Podcasts should really just have their own app
- Interface just too different
- Library of episodes? Of podcasts? Adding individual episodes to a library?
- Downloaded makes more sense, or in progress episodes, following a podcast is different than having in library
- Play bar also requires different features
- Queue way less important in podcasts too (most trips don't span multiple episodes)
- Why would u want to listen to podcast content interspersed with music?
