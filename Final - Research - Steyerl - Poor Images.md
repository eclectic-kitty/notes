# Final - Research - Steyerl - Poor Images

## My Overall Thots


## Intro - Poor Image?

Constantly deteriorated and reshaped
Passed along freely
"**transforms** quality into accesibility"
Abstract, idea in **becoming**
unique to digital tech, mocks its promises
**violent** dislocation

## 1. Low Resolutions

Focus is a **class position**
high res = high class, flagship
low res = derivatives
high res images, more rich
rich image establishes **hierarchies**
35 mm film, pristine, etc.
national culture, capitalist studio production, cult of male genius, **original** version
new tech allows to creatively degrade

## 2. Resurrection

insistence on rich images obscures anything lower
sometimes less important (ex. personally not watching movies on ur phone)
larger systemic consequences
	- neoliberal influence on media production
		- **Culture = commodity**
		- monopolies in media spaces
	- obscuring non-commercial cinema
		- **Too expensive** to screen, show on TV
		- Lived only in **"darkness of the archive"**

*Does she mean that they weren't made or weren't shown? (probably both)
Would it be possible for poorer copies to circulate? (seemingly yes? but not very efficiently pre-internet?)*

Somewhat lived on in alternate archives
VHS copies
Much easier now on internet, AVI files, theatre recordings, etc.
**resurrected** as poor images

## 3. Privatization & Piracy

Poor images not assigned any value in class society of images
as illicit or degraded, exemption from criteria
post-socialist & postcolonial restructuring of nation states
cultures, traditions, histories reinvented
film archives affected 
(*what does she mean that they were left without their supporting framework of national culture?*)

Archives end up privatized, rented out
allowing pirate copies to be distributed
poor image reveals decline & degradation of experimental cinema
originally made possible as culture production was task of state
privatization of intellectual property, marketing, commodification,
enable piracy & appropriation

## 4 Imperfect Cinema

Juan Garcia Espinosa: imperfect cinema
overcome divisions of labor, merging art with life & science, popular but not consumerist, etc.
inherently progressive, as opposed to reactionary perfect cinema
thought new tech & media would enable production from masses
**diminish distinction** b/ audience and author

Ultimately far messier
Lots of reactionary content
still commodified
represent the crowd in all its **contradictions**
countless people involved changing it bit by bit (*teehee*)

Redefined value of image?
not just resolution and exhange value (*???*), but also **velocity** intensity and **spread** (*virality?*)
compressed, travel quickly
semiotic production (*focus on symbols*)
**compressed**, flexible, **combine-able**, reintagrate-able

flattening of content, concept-in-becoming
General trend, tearing ideas out of context
'swirl of permanent capitalist deterritorialization
like conceptual art before it,
resistant to fetish value of visibility, high resolution
well suited for **tearing away context**, symbolization
compressed attention spance, impression rather than immersion, etc.

## 5 Comrade, what is your visual bond today?

easy spread -> new economy, circuit
marginalised content resurfaces more
builds **shared histories** and **networks** amongst people
not as reliant on corporations or states for framework
aura not based on permanence of original, but **transience** of copy 
(*yeah, don't really know what all this means*)
(*By being able to move around it's better at creating networks among its audiences and redistributors?*)

**visual bonds**
Dziga Vertov
communist visual language
inform, etnertain, organize viewers
more or less reality under information capitalism
audiences linked physically, excitement, anxiety

Peter Weiss, Aesthetics of Resistance, Third Cinema, Tricontinentalism
pamphlets, agit-prop films, underground zines, etc.
nonconformist media, **poor materials**
reactualizing historical ideas from these older forms

what is our visual bond today? link to the present

## 6 Now

A shifting of cirumstances
original **real thing** no longer important
