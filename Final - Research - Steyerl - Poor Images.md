# Final - Research - Steyerl - Poor Images

## Intro - Poor Image?

Constantly deteriorated and reshaped
Passed along freely
"**transforms** quality into accesibility"
Abstract, idea in **becoming**
unique to digital tech, mocks its promises
**violent** dislocation

## 1. Low Resolutions

Focus is a class position
high res = high class, flagship
low res = derivatives
high res images, more rich
rich image establishes hierarchies
35 mm film, pristine, etc.
national culture, capitalist studio production, cult of male genius, **original** version
new tech allows to creatively degrade

## 2. Resurrection

insistence on rich images obscures anything lower
sometimes less important (ex. personally not watching movies on ur phone)
larger systemic consequences
	- neoliberal influence on media production
		- Culture = commodity
		- monopolies in media spaces
	- obscuring non-commercial cinema
		- Too expensive to screen, show on TV
		- Lived only in "darkness of the archive"

*Does she mean that they weren't made or weren't shown? (probably both)
Would it be possible for poorer copies to circulate? (seemingly yes? but not very efficiently pre-internet?)*

Somewhat lived on in alternate archives
VHS copies
Much easier now on internet, AVI files, theatre recordings, etc.
**resurrected** as poor images

## 3. Privatization & Piracy
