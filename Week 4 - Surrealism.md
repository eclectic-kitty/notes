# Week 4 - Surrealism

Mexican surrealism considered part of the Rupture Generation
Search for a non-nationalistic national aesthetic
Strong focus on self-representation
Served to question gender roles

## Word association
uncanny
dreamlike
alternate realities
esoteric
illogic
subconscious 

## History
### Freud's Impact
Legitimisation of the unconscious and dreams to 
Ideas on desire, violence, sexuality, unconscious
Deeper understanding of mind and emotions
Theoretical basis for surrealism

### Origins
Literary movement
Automatism: opening the conscious mind to the unconscious
Tapping into a deeper imagination
Contemporaneous to the muralist movement
Also rather political

### Andre Breton
Believed surrealism was a purely automatic art
Losing control: most important element of surrealism
Published Manifestoes of Surrealism
Central figure of the Surrealist Group (Dali, Elouard, Man Ray, Ernst, etc.)
Interdisciplinary group

Andre Masson applied automatism to visual art in the '20s
Suppressing consciousness

### Dream Picture Surrealism
Unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision
Very formalistic, contrary to automatism
A very different way of allowing unconscious expression

## Surrealism in Mexico
European surrealist movement dissolved due to WWII
Artists fled to the Americas

Breton accepted French government assignment to lecture about surrealism in Mexico, got lost referred to the country as the most surrealist country in the world
Dali also called the country more surrealist than his paintings

Breton met Trotsky while he stayed with Rivera and Kahlo ('38)
Breton and Trotsky wrote a manifesto together
Calling for freedom of art
Eventually organized 4th international surrealist exhibition in Mexico
Curated by:

Wolfgang Paalen:
German Austrian Mexican painter who joined movement
Created Dyn magazine 
international, ran for 4 issues
Printed in Mexico, distributed in English and Spanish
Contained many surrealist artworks

No existing surrealist artists in Mexico...
(Kahlo and Rivera participated,,,)
(Even Kahlo did not consider herself a surrealist)
Helped to set the stage for female artists

## Female artists and the Surrealist movement
More formalistic,
influenced by dream side of surrealism
Concerned with their own experiences as women
Nevertheless, not disconnected with reality
Contrary, politically engaged for women's space in the art scene

Kahlo and Izquierdo were assigned label of surrealist by men
Lots of fucking gross "primitivism" assigned to Kahlo and Izquierdo by the male European surrealists, such as Breton

Kati Horna, Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo
V close friends
all immigrated to Mexico, fled
Dubbed 3 witches

### Kati Horna
Photographer
Less geometrical, v dreamlike
double exposures, collages, etc.

### Maria Izquierdo (1902 - 1955)
Born in Jalisco
Grew up in a small town, v delineated gender roles
Married to officer by family, had three children by 17

After moving to Mexico City in the '20s,
Left her husband and went to National School of Painting
avant-gardiste, modern
Incorpoprated some folk elements
Rivera called her work fundamentally Mexican
Legitimized her career
Dated Rufino Tamayo, who she met in school

Performance
Focus on women
Uncanny, empty environments
A lot of movement, acrobacy, very clear brushstrokes
WOmen facing away
An acrobatic act to maintain identity, woman seeing herself in the mirror
Dissociation, mannequin, mirror, performance

First (Mexican?) woman to have a solo exhibition in New York in the '30s

Dismemberment,
doubles of herself
more symbolism, free association

Suffered a stroke in the '40s
Lost a commission from the federal government due to Rivera claiming she wasn't talented enough

### Frida Kahlo
Most famous female Mexican artist
Considered merely Rivera's wife until the '80s
Breton, despite his exoticisation and misogyny, one of the first people to recognize her work as important
Rejected the surrealist label imposed on her by Breton
Considered her work to oreflect her reality more than her dreams

Contracted polio at six
Became very introverted
Also was in bus accident as a teenager
Lifelong complications, many months of recovery, plaster corset
Began painting while recovering, painted from bed

Painted more than 70 self-portraits
Suggested she painted herself due to so often being alone and her self being the subject she knew the best

Joined communist party,
Friends with Tina Modotti, introduced her to politics, Rivera
Married Rivera
42 years of difference, already married
Kahlo referred to Diego as one of two worst accidents in her life
Numerous extramarital affairs
Diego accepted Kahlo's relationships with women, but not men
Diego also had an affair with her sister

Self portrait along the border line...
More natural imagery v. industrial imagery
v little colour, save for Frida's dress
A very European dress
A Mexican flag not being waved but held nonetheless

Many miscarriages throughout her life
Infertility v resent throughout her work
her knee had to be amputated, became very depressed
"Espero alegre la salida, y espero no regresar jamas"
Rivera considered her death the most tragic event in his life, died three years later

### Remedios Varo
Spanish-Mexican
Anarchist
Met Dali in Europe, big influence on her
Flew to Paris during Spanish Civil War
Took part in International Surrealist Exhibition there
Flew then to Mexico due to WWII
Knew Rivera and Kahlo, but not close
Closer to Horna, Carrington, etc.
Contemporary to muralism, thus very underground

Inhuman subjects, more fictional
Occult, esoteric, exploration into dreams
Very fantastical, but
Internal logic to the spaces
More coherent spaces, scenes
Precise perspective, strong depth to the images
Far less flat, movement is less left-to right but from out to in, front to back
Precise architecture
Interiors
Constructed spaces
Subjects, despite less human, remain feminine or androgynous
Subjects are empowered in these spaces
Focused inward, elegant, studying

Engineer father
In contact with science from a young age
Passionate about occult, esoteric beliefs

### Leonora Carrington
English, born in Lancanshire
Born to wealthy family, expensive education
Expelled twice, rebellious
Art career discouraged by father, but encouraged by mother
Moved to Paris to continue studying
Met Max Ernst, married him and settled there
Max Ernst taken by German authorities
Had to flee to Madrid, then to Mexico
Interned into psychiatric hospital
strong trauma from losing contact with Ernst and stay in hospital

Similarly also focused on interiors, but a bit less
Even then, if scene is interor, exterior is present, in the window
Women empowered in these spaces
Again, relatively more coherent spaces,
if a bit less precisely constructed than Varo
Hyena: alter-ego

Collaborated in theatre,
worked on stages
Alejandro Jodorowsky: friend and disciple

## Edward James
wealthy english patron of Carrington's
Lived in various different places
Loved surrealism
Created surrealist sculptural garden in San Luis Potosi
Las Pozas, Xilitla
