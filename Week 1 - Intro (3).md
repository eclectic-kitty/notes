# Week 1 - Intro

## Fear
We are afraid of death of course, of violence and sickness and suffering, of being exposed and humiliated and shunned and persectured. We are afraid of being erased, or unseen, or forgotten. **We are afraid of being alone.**

## 7 Theses of mosnters
monster has same root as montrer, it points to something
it's the incarnation or reflection of societal anxieties

Demchuk points out how often the monstrous is associated with a secret side, an underground


### I - The monster's body is a cultural body
The monstrous body is pure culture. A construct and a aprojection; it exists only to be read
It's an embodiment of a certain point in time-space

Horror historically a conservative genre
It necessarily involves fear, a reactionary emotion
Early on, the stories also would end in a return to normality

Over time, this conservativeness shifts as the audience begins to identify more with the monster

#### The Christmas Effect
The assumption that everyone is Christian, has family, is celebrating
All the institutions speaking in one voice

### II - The mosnter always escapes
It always comes back, it is never defeated completely
The cycle always repeats

### III - Category Crisis
The lines in gender, nature, science, etc. blur
The mosnter's very existence is a rebuke to boundary and culture

Bodies don't behave the way they're meant to

The very existence of a queer community challenges typical society

### IV - The monster dwells at the gates of difference
Any kind of difference among these categories are arbitrary
By revealing they can be transgressed, the monster threatens social appartuses at large

### V - The monster polices the borders of the possible

### VI - Fear of the monster is really a kind of desire
The monster is linked to forbidden practices 
The monster also attracts
The monster represents an attraction to these 

### VII - The monster is on the verge of becoming
They are our children
They can be pushed to the edges, bur always return
