# Poem Workshop Feedback

## moon Kabir - Moving Prayer

#### 1. What were your first impressions as a reader?
One of my first impressions was the rapid shift in tone from the first stanza to the second. It starts out very dark and somber, before it's interrupted by the friend's call, and gets more and more hopeful from there on, even humorous. I was also struck by the ebb and flow of the length of stanzas, especially compared to my much more rigid poem. It gives the poem a lot of motion.

#### 2. What is the poem about?
It seems to be about finding mechanisms for coping with / strength / hope to live through depression. Specifically, the poem seems to focus on, through the lens of prayer, connection with a loved one and music as the reasons to continue. 

#### 3. Can you identify the poem's intention?
With regards to the intention, the word "moving" in the title sticks out to me, perhaps alluding to the need to not stay still? staying still as a trap one can fall into? It seems to propose the repetition/cycle/movement of prayer and song and the connection that stems from it as important tools with which to deal with depression. The way in which they can lend one strength and confidence through communicating feelings and experiences.

#### 4. What formal devices does the poem use?
There's some recurring imagery I recognized, such as that of cycles and repetition, of movement and dance, of music and communication. There's also moments where stanza length is heavily limited for pacing. There's also what appears to be a quote at the end.

#### 5. Develop one or two questions to ask your peers:
What was it in the Peso Pluma song that so captivated you? Was it the rhythm? The melody? Did the lyrics match the emotions the song gave you?

What is it about the phrase "moving prayer" that most attracted you? It seems to me, at least, to be one of the most abstract metaphors in an otherwise almost prose-like poem. Was this contrast an intentional decision or an accident?


### Feedback!? for me??!??
