# Week 5 - Poetry

## Readings

### Wild Geese - Mary Oliver
enjambment
- emphasizes separate bits of a sentence
- rhythm
starting of lines at beginning of poem: "you" statements
Then "tell me", then "meanwhile" with 

Nature associations
vastness, environmentalism, connection, spirituality, freedom, purity, groundedness

### The Fish - Marianne Moore
Form similar to the ocean
Most of it under the surface?
Jagged, sonic quality
Like how fish turn constantly?

Sparse capitalization
Walking into the middle of the poem

## Poetic terms
### Imagery
Could be direct or literal, representative of meaning, rather than meaning itself
invokes the five senses
Something you *feel* in your body
vivid or figurative


### Metaphor
A direct comparison of two unlike things

## Close reading exercise

### Personal Poem - Frank O'Hara
The blockiness of the poem is a big sudden thing
Makes the rhythm very run-on
Stream of consciousness
The amount of white space constrains the rest of the poem
travelling!, *run* on

"I only have two charms in my pocket"
mysticism, magical,
But very clear, almost mundane objects themselves =

Was he not happy in New York?

"luminous humidity"
Basking in a typically unpleasant feeling
love "wet" as a noun

Lots of storytelling, specific places, people, and personal experience

Want to be rich, construction imagery but impractical hard hat

Full names instead of just first name
similar to memory, not actively in your life anymore

Strong sense of place and time
Miles Davis beating treated somewhat trivially
Is this how he feels or pointing out the trivialization?

###
Even more just a paragraph, but the sentences end more
longest part is about historical atrocities

Pairing of personal moments of being a child, sense of place, racism
Contrasted with historical events
"before"
Historical context didn't exist before when writer was a kid
History displaces history

"before white men pressing against brown women, nailing crosses by the river"
at first less shocking, directly heinous, but that just makes it more horrifying
violence against the land itself

Under the redwood tree
Event in the roots

Heaven is pressed...
(pressed shows up earlier too)

What makes this (more of) a poem?
A lot of gaps
Elements that represent concepts and emotions not regularly
Text almost, but doesn't quite extend to the end of the page

## Haikus
5-7-5
simplicity, brevity, clarity
clarity of mind
reflective or meditative state
often focus on nature or seasonal themes
Often the title is the first line

A lot of English poets will write inspired by haikus without following the syllabic pattern

Economy
Individual words become very important
