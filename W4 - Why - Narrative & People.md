# Narrative (finishing up from last week)

## Types of narrative
- Embedded
Story is embedded in the game, unchangeable
- Emergent
Dynamic stories that emerge in the moment, player has agency

## Chroniqueur
Jonathan's current project, emergent narrative
Making games for research requires some question you're exploring

Crusader Kings anecdote:
In CK, you play as an entire line of kings, so you need to think about your heirs and prepare for after each king's death
Politics are interpersonal and your underlings need to trust the monarch in order for them to listen to you
Jonathan's playing as an aging King, prepares for death
Queen dies instead! Possibility for a new wife in order to help pass over reign
King marries new woman, going well
New child! Politically, this baby is the new heir, everyone hates the King now, easy target politically
Folly, greed, took a chance, did not pay off
Possible solution? Assassinating baby?
Tough moral choice, Jonathan feels bad, kills him
New new child!!!
At this point, choice is easier.

Crusader Kings is not an easy game to get into though, not accessible
Wants to make emrgent narratives more accessible
What if the narratives were already there and one had to look for them?

Croniqueur 
Randomly generates a continent-full of people and an encyclopedia
Players can read through the encyclopedia as the game happens
Players can also take control of a player as well and shape the story here or there

How does one design a narrative game around emergent narratives?
What do people find interesting? How to make one care about a whole continent of people?

No hero, everyone's equal. Whatever NPCs can do, players can do as well
Currently, theoretically it's interesting, but practically, NPCs aren't doing big interesting things, game doesn't emphasize what's interesting

## Role Play!
- Improv theatre
- Collaborative storytelling games (ex. Once Upon a Time)
- Tabletop RPGs
- Live Action RPGs

**Costs** of RPGs
- Performance
Timid players, playing with strangers, can be scary, difficult
- Presence and awareness
One must remember state of world
- Creativity
- Public speaking
- Risk taking
- Coordination
- Preparation

**Rewards** of RPGs
- Strong agency
You can do pretty much anything within the game world, no determined verbs
Could even be random!
- Creative output
I made this!!!
- Co-creation, fellowship
Surprising contributions of others! Playing with others!
- Complicity

# Why do we play?
Challenge, discovering, in a safe environment
Creativity, narrative, exploration of alternative things, in a safe environment

___

# Presentation thots

## First guy
Talked about a cave with weake enemies but a telporting chest trap, how he got out
Missed intro, of what I saw, mostly description of moment?
Wraps up at the conclusion
Jonathan: good focus on small loop, connects to larger loop at end, meta-read obstaacle from a game design perspective

## Second guy
Talked about the micro, macro and meta loops of Binding of Isaac
Not getting a story really???
Not explaining certain specific things (rerolling items)
A lot of events
However, explaining some of the micro loops, went with more of a general example
Very technical though, very precise about game systems, difficult to follow
Jonathan: Going into macro/meta loops (new concept) - community knowledge and patches, stats, didn't talk toooo much about basic idea of game

## Third guy
Analysed a single match of Clash Royale

I have to:
- Analyse a specific moment I loved in a game
- Scale that to a macro level, use moment to explain why I return to the game/played it to its completion, etc.

___

# People
Interacting with other people

## People Fun
4 keys to fun, Nicole Lazzaro
Create opportunities for player competitiong, cooperation, performance & spectacle
People play games they wouldn't otherwise with friends
Wisecracks, rivalries, player interaction
Teamwork and camaraderie through shared goals
Dominant emotions:
- Amusement
- Schadefreude
- Naches
Quotes:
- "People are addictive, not the game"
- "I want an excuse to invite my freinds over"

## Single-player games, an anomaly?
Pre-digital, most games were multiplayer (except solitaires)
Computer games allow more meaningful single-player involvement

Computer as replacement for players
Adventure - Crowther, Woods - 1976
D&D inspired
One talks to the computer, tells it what to do
Reduces role-playing, agency, emergent stories - **rewards**
Reduces finding people, preparing, acting - **costs**

Single-player was the norm until networking became possible
1990's LAN parties, needing to transport giant towers
Despite difficulties, multiplayer was still attractive
Younger the gamer, the more multiplayer is preferred
At every age, single player is preferred by more
People who play the most, tend to play multiplayer games

## People **Rewards**
Source of:
- Challenge
- Uncertainty
- Surprise
- Complexity
- Stories
- Competition
Most aspects of games are generally augmented by presence of others

## People **costs**
- Access to potential players (relationship, taste)
- Coordination (moment, game type, availability)
- Social demands, initiating and maintaining play
- Vulnerability of public performance

Anonymous online play lowers costs, but lowers rewards

Social motivating factors
multiplayer can emphasize aspects, but what do they contribute uniquely?
What can't be replaced with AI?

## Games as social lubricant
Can be socially demanding to initiate
but it also reduces stress, you know what to do, how to interact
Provides clear frame for social situation
ex. board/card games as classic family gathering activity
Can be helpful with new or well-known people

Community
Common interests connect people
Gives frame, context, pretext for seeing people
One can just play game as they talk with friends and spend time

## **Meta**
Greek, = beyond
Accumulated knowledge about a game
Ex. stats, items, strategies, chess openings, charm combos
Unwritten rules, etiquette
Ex. When to abandon game

## Spectacle, performance
E-sports, watching matches
Playing for an audience
Enjoying a game without having to perform
Streaming: Provides context for player and people to talk to each other

Designing *for* spectacle
Ex. Joust
Started with giant armies fighting each other, spanned kilometres
Impossible to follow, messy, etc.
Exercise for knights to learn to cooperate, be tactical, etc.
Eventually became 1 v 1 to facilitate watchability
Became easy to read, literally 1-dimensional in order to be easy to watch

## Exploring social behaviours
- Collaboration (ex. escape rooms)
- Team coordination (team (e)sports)
- Leadership (ex. coordinating 20 healers in WOW)
- Role specialization (healer, tank, etc.)
- Role identities (roleplaying as types of people)

Acceptable anti-social behaviour
- Uninhibited competition
- Schadenfreude
- Betrayal
- "Low blows"
- Lying
Ex. Among Us, Werewolf, Bullshit, Hidden role games
