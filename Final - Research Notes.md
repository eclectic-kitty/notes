# Final - Research Notes

## Film Bodies - Linda Williams
#### P1
What is gross often disagreed upon
"gross" often invoked to exclude things, not analyse
"sensational", no purpose other than to excite

### P2 - excess
kissing movies, body horror, sad movies
gratouitous sex, violence, emotion
Three **body** genres
porn, horror, melodrama

**"stylistic and/or emotional excess"**
"contrast to **'dominant'** modes of realistic, goal-oriented narrative"
"lapses in realism"
"primal or infantile emotions"

### P3 - 3 features
3 Pertinent features of **bodily** excess
- spectacle
	- **loss of control** of body
	- intense sensations/emotions
		- Carol Clover: horror & porn "sensational 'body' genres"
		- extended to 'weepies' by Williams, "sensation of overwhelming pathos"
	- **orgasm, violence & terror, weeping**
	- gender construction & address in relation to fantasies? (point of departure for study)
- ecstasy
	- Greek word: **insanity**
	- pleasure, **rapture**
	- Elements
		- visual: convulsions, spasms
		- auditory: screams, sobs, cries /pos
	- despite varying int. audiences, bodies in ecstasy: **womens'**
		- **Foucault** !! sexual saturation, some of most powerful sensations for audiences
- mimicry
	- audience bodies in same ecstasy as those portrayed
	- hence, gratouitous, excessive, etc.
	- Success measured in response (p4)

### P4 - manipulation
Lack of easthetic distance, **manipulated**
(tear jerker)
Mary Ann Doane "textual rape, **targeted** female viewer, feminized through pathos"

Robin Morgan "porn is the theory, rape is the practice"
sexually ecstatic woman: central figure of porn = celebration of female victimization

spectacle of monster? or woman?
King Kong, monster & woman, classic form
final girls and other victims take precedence over monster

woman sacrificing something

is excess simply marked by woman, fluids, mimicry? (p5)
How do these bodily displays relate to one another? (p5)


### P5


### P7

"Identification is neither fixed, nor entirely passive"

### P8

"The more useful lesson might be to see what this new fluidity and oscillation permits in the construction of feminine viewing pleasures once thought notn to exist at all"

### P9

"Fantasy is ... a setting for desire, a place where conscious and unconscious, self and other, part and whole meet"

*thought: Human Botany, brings in the legitimizing lens of science, revealing a contradiction in how bodies are viewed, questioning the legitimacy of the viewer, the camera itself
