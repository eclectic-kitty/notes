# Final - Research Notes

## Anatomy
Hill House quote: "No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality..." This seems to me to relate to abjection? Abjection seems at least in part to be about people confronted with the utter reality of things, of their conception of self and other. They're dreams we tell ourselves. 
The house loses conception of itself and begins to bleed into itself (recursive) after faced with a radical reshaping of its reality, its conception of self, of being seen as object.

bedroom, trust, bringing attention to our relationship, reliance

shutting off, returning, jouissance and wandering???

dissection and vivisection, not understanding the aliveness of what we interact with
difference between sympathy and empathy. The game starts from the premise that we see our homes as reflections of ourselves, but crucially, not as their own beings. They are ours to dissect, to poke and prod as we please

house rebels by changing its anatomy to reflect us less and less, it creates impossible spaces, changes to become less useful for us, and ultimately devour us.

It dreams of us, is haunted by us, longs for further connection, to return to a time when its borders were better defined

## Film Bodies - Linda Williams
#### P1
What is gross often disagreed upon
"gross" often invoked to exclude things, not analyse
"sensational", no purpose other than to excite

### P2 - excess
kissing movies, body horror, sad movies
gratouitous sex, violence, emotion
Three **body** genres
porn, horror, melodrama

**"stylistic and/or emotional excess"**
"contrast to **'dominant'** modes of realistic, goal-oriented narrative"
"lapses in realism"
"primal or infantile emotions"

### P3 - 3 features
3 Pertinent features of **bodily** excess
- spectacle
	- **loss of control** of body
	- intense sensations/emotions
		- Carol Clover: horror & porn "sensational 'body' genres"
		- extended to 'weepies' by Williams, "sensation of overwhelming pathos"
	- **orgasm, violence & terror, weeping**
	- gender construction & address in relation to fantasies? (point of departure for study)
- ecstasy
	- Greek word: **insanity**
	- pleasure, **rapture**
	- Elements
		- visual: convulsions, spasms
		- auditory: screams, sobs, cries /pos
	- despite varying int. audiences, bodies in ecstasy: **womens'**
		- **Foucault** !! sexual saturation, some of most powerful sensations for audiences
- mimicry
	- audience bodies in same ecstasy as those portrayed
	- hence, gratouitous, excessive, etc.
	- Success measured in response (p4)

### P4 - manipulation
Lack of easthetic distance, **manipulated**
(tear jerker)
Mary Ann Doane "textual rape, **targeted** female viewer, feminized through pathos"

Robin Morgan "porn is the theory, rape is the practice"
sexually ecstatic woman: central figure of porn = celebration of female victimization

spectacle of monster? or woman?
King Kong, monster & woman, classic form
final girls and other victims take precedence over monster

woman sacrificing something

is excess simply marked by woman, fluids, mimicry? (p5)
How do these bodily displays relate to one another? (p5)


### P5


### P7

"Identification is neither fixed, nor entirely passive"

### P8

"The more useful lesson might be to see what this new fluidity and oscillation permits in the construction of feminine viewing pleasures once thought notn to exist at all"

### P9

"Fantasy is ... a setting for desire, a place where conscious and unconscious, self and other, part and whole meet"

*thought: Human Botany, brings in the legitimizing lens of science, revealing a contradiction in how bodies are viewed, questioning the legitimacy of the viewer, the camera itself
