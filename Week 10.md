# Week 10

## Proposals and final projects, general notes
### Essays
- Make sure to define terms!
- Complex/nuance argument throuhg word choice
	- Look through words to see if there are more precise terms
- Link arguments to concrete, specific examples

### Grammar/Style
- Italicize titles!
- Use paragraph breaks!
	- A paragraph should def. not be longer than a page
	- Coherent block of thinking
- Make sure that there is cogency, "flow", between sections in paper

### Outline and structure
You are building an argument
No need for a preset structure
What information do you need to present so that your reader can understand/follow your argument?
What order does your reader need that information in in order to understand your argument?

Each paragraph/section should have:
- A mini argument
	- Even just stating, this is a word I'll be using and how
	- Or a description of the game
- Evidence to support that mini argument
	- quotes
	- description
- Your commentary/analysis of that evidence
- Each paragraph (no set number) builds upon the next to make the case for the solidity of your argument

### Example structure
Introduction
	- introduces topic and subject
	- states argument
	- suggests execution

S1 Define key terms
- define representation
- state why rep. matters

S2 Contextualize Apex Legends
- provide background (game context, genre, pov)
- game summary

S3 Analysis 
	- Analysis 1: Character selection
	- Analysis 2: The opening minute
	- Analysis 3: as the game goes on

Conclusion
	- Connect Apex to issues in FPS more broadly
	- Suggest the need for new strategies for representation

### Outline exercise
Introduction
	- I'm gonna talk about Alan Wake and rituals!
	- It uses the imagery of rituals and narrative structure in order to talk about personal growth
	- There is a common goal between personal growth and rituals, the element of authority illuminates the difficulty of overcoming loops, the changeability of rituals gives one hope that their behaviour can be changed

## Sustainability
"Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" - UN definition

UN identifies 17 goal areas of sustainability
- poverty
- hunger
- health
- education
- gender equality
- water and sanitation
- energy
- economic growth
- infrastructure, industrialization
- inequality
- cities
- sustainable consumption and production

### Capitalism
An economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and the operation of the means of production to produce profit - Marxist definition

Terms:
- worker
	- somebody who performs task for compensation
- owner
	- controls assets, means of production
	- ex. shareholders, boards, landlords, CEOs
	- there are degrees of ownership
- commodity
	- a product of work that happens and is owned by someone not doing the work (can circulate)
	- the aspect of circulation is less 

Capitalism is a global system nowadays
throughout history, there have been increases and decreases in worldly interconnectedness

### Global flows & Scapes
Can be useful to talk about globalisation

multi-dimensional approach for identifying processes
not a single phenomenon
dynamic and overlapping, often contradictory flows or processes

1) ethnoscapes, movement of people
	- Before it would have been unthinkable, to say, go to Australia
2) mediascapes, movement of communication (media)
	- We watch a *lot* of American TV or films
	- in film festivals, often more of an international sources
3) technoscapes, movement of tech
	- Technology is available in various different places, variable
4) financescapes, movement of money and integration of economies
	- pandemic is an example of how interconnected world is
4) ideoscapes, movement of ideologies

Workers perform tasks that create value in other places
Video games make a huge amount of money, huge amount of value
Are present across the world

### Oops went to the bathroom time to catch up

## Submissive landscapes
gameworld that exists simply for the player to exert its will upon it
There is no consequence for the player when they take from the world

Ex. Skyrim
Landscape initially is presented with a lot of pomp, but ultimately does not do anything else

Ex. No Man's Sky
initially considered a critical failure upon release
Procedurally generated planets
The environment does have agency, despite gameplay loop of mining and collecting resources
hostile flora and fauna, hazardous environments, storms

## Discussion
No Man's Sky has land agency, but the gameplay loop still wants you to take form the land
Its world might have more agency than a game like Skyrim, but it's still not quite about functioning sustainability
It does have the gameplay loop of learning about the environment, exploring the environment

Agency, what is it?
Decisiveness, influence, acting and reacting
In research, does it have agency beyond simply being counted?
Is assertion the same thing as agency?

Interactions are underpinned by certain logics
Skyrim has beautiful graphics, nature is there,
but doesn't offset the resource gathering colonial logics
fast travel denies even needing to interact with the environment

Outer Wilds explores similar ideas to No Man's Sky in completely different ways
interactions are merely navigating and learning, no element of mining, taking from environment
Instead of generated functionally infinite universe, only has a few planets

## Juliet Singh (?) article
wild erranding

### Errand
A message, a verbal communication to be repeated by a third party
a short journey on which a person is sent to take a message, collect goods or perform some similar small task/ To run on errands, to go on an errand
- Oxford English Dictionary

Ex. getting the piece of chalk for Kelsey!

Singh:
moves more or less aggressively among bodies
hierarchy
- Someone is authorized to create the message
- others are employed to perform
- (less focus) might not be desired)

The roles of giving and performing could be same person, 
Present self giving future self something you need to do

transmission of language and intent, enforcement of power, excuse for oft-unwanted entry into an elsewhere

#### Colonial errand
act of entering wilderness, in order to convert, destroy, civilize.
Ot does so through the force and play of some bodies against others, through enforced delivery of messages that articulate and require the destruction of all that is 'wild' in the environment

#### Fetch quest
Task mission within an rpg given to player in which objects must be acquired and brought back to quest giver

#### ???
items are resources, exist only for player's use
we rarely see an effect on land, env.
constant respawning doesn't take this into account

### BotW
open world
environment v important
day and night, resources
some literal fetch-quests
but even when not, Link always needs to take from environment in order to continue quest

#### discussion
- apply fetch quest to the game
	- Lots of direct fetch quests with people
	- food and weapons
		- need resources to craft these
	- Korok seeds
- concept of errand 
	- Shrines an errand
	- Needing to go get Ganon
- Principles that underpin
	- Navigating environment, can't skip over it much, 
	
Game lets you decide what errands you want to undertake
a lot of agency is given to the player
Thus, do the game's quests really count as errands?

The environment is afforded a certain amount of agency as it is not trivial to traverse the land, one spends a lot of time and brain power figuring out how to traverse the environment
