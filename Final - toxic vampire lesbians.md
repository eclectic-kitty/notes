# Final - toxic vampire lesbians

I stare into her, into her deep brown eyes, drinking in her hypnotized gaze for what feels like an eternity. I look down at her blood-red lips and I can just about feel how soft they are against mine. Her collarbones look pink in the moonlight that filters through her sheer curtains.

The air is thick and sweet with her. I'm just a few feet away from her as she sits on her bed, surrounded by all her fuzzy pillows. Her room is so small that her body heat is more than enough to fill it, reflecting off its small walls. It's by no means the first time I've been here, but those moments feel so far away right now.

There's barely any reaction as I move onto the bed, throwing off a few pillows in the process. I touch her thigh. She's so warm, I shudder, but she stays perfectly still. I know she wouldn't be able to make the first move, even if she wanted to, but she's simply far too beautiful like this for me to break the spell.

We could stay here forever.

It's been a couple of hours now and the bar is still empty. The bartender is wiping the same cup she's already wiped at least twice. The alcohol I've had to sip to keep her from glaring at me isn't filling the pit in my gut. As I contemplate the futility of trying a peanut, the bell on the door rings. I turn, and for a moment, it feels like the pit will swallow my flesh whole.

She's dressed in a thigh-length pink pleated skirt, with a matching cropped sweater. Her cheeks are flushed from cheap booze and I can taste rich iron on my tongue. The richest eyes I've ever seen scan the room once over, then back, and settle into mine for a moment.

"C'mon guys! It doesn't look that bad in here. Worst case scenario, Sam, you can just get something in a bottle or whatever."

"Lau—"

"Shh, at least one drink. The night is young!"

The girls settle into a corner across the room and I try my best not to stare. Somehow, this is worse than the bar being empty. She smells of marzipan and her laugh is so warm. Every time she turns, I have to dig my nails into my thigh. Thankfully, her friends don't take too long to filter out, leaving her and one other girl alone.

"Laura, I can't leave you alone, let's go home. You had your chance to talk to her."

As she says this, I glide across the room. and flash the friend a smile "Oh, hey, I was going to stay a bit longer anyway. I can make sure she gets home."

She looks me up and down for a moment.

"See, it's fine! She— What's your name?" Laura asks.

"Vic. You're Laura, right?"

"Yep!" She turns back. "Anyway, Vic here'll take care of me." She then leans in and whispers, entirely audibly, "Also she's so hot, please, Sam. I mean, that leather jacket!"

"Don't worry, I'll keep her safe," I say, staring deep into Sam's eyes with a smile.

"Safe... Yeah, okay."

"Awesome, thanks Sam, I'll see you soon, love you, bye!" Laura says, pretty much shoving her away. "Alright, so, Vic! Right?" she says, before turning back to me. "Do you have a switchblade or something like that? To keep me safe, that is!" She giggles, her brown eyes staring up into mine.

For a moment I see green eyes, empty, lying in the alleyway. Something wriggles in the corner of the left eye.

As we're leaving the bar an hour later, the pit in my stomach is stronger than ever, but I just walk her back to her apartment. At the doorway, she stares into me again.

---

I could stay there forever.

The pit grows far, far too heavy. My mouth is on hers in an instant and I push her back onto the bed. We sink in, cradled in pillows, our chests against each other. My tongue is in her mouth and it's so warm. She moans into my mouth and her hands are all over my back. I suck on her lower lip, bite it, hard. In an instant, her nails are in my back and it's sharp and I melt into her. Eventually, I prop myself up so I can stare down into her. There's beads of sweat on her forehead and she's red.

"God. You're so gorgeous."

She somehow blushes even more. "Mmmf, no... You're gorgeous..."

"Shush," I say, before kissing her again.

I begin to move down. I kiss her chin. Then, under, I kiss her neck. She moans softly in my ear. I lick her neck and she shudders. Salty musk and marzipan fills my head. The pit is roaring now It takes so much strength, but I manage to hold back. I keep moving down towards her collarbone, casting a shadow on her chest. Then down again, towards her breasts. She holds my head against her then, and I let her. It's not like she can suffocate me anyway. 

With a soft bite, she lets go, and I move back to her neck. Her heart beats so fast against mine.

"Vic, please," she whines.

"Patience, baby."

"Don'—"

Before she can finish, I'm sucking hard on the base of her neck and her breath hitches. I can taste the blood blooming under her skin. It's iron and sweet and I almost give in but Laura whimpering brings me back. I let go and prop myself up again. She doesn't open her eyes. I see her chest rise and fall erratically. I feel her leg twitch. Her eyes flicker open. I'm so hungry.

---

I stare into her again. She stares back into me.

---

"Vic, I know." 

Her voice is the only sound in the world. I watch the snowflakes twirl through the air, white against the mist. The snow is piling up in the fountain in front of us.

"Well, fuck."

"Vic, don't worry I— I don't care.""

"I really hoped you wouldn't find out." I finally look back at her. She looks like she's about to laugh.

"Girl, you work night shifts as a security guard, you had no food in your fridge the first night I came over, and we've literally never seen each other in the sun. To be honest, I'm surprised it took me as long as it did."

"Well alright, if you put it that way." I smile back at her. "I mean, it's not like you see much sunlight either." She rolls her eyes.

"It's not my fault I'm too stupid to get a job." She says it with a smile that doesn't quite make it up to her eyes.

"Baby, don't say shit like that. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way."

She turns her head down. "Oh, fuck, instinct. I— I know you didn't."

"I love you."

"Love you too," she says, turning back to me with a full smile.

She looks so warm. For a moment, her eyes look green.

"Laura... Please don't think I'd ever hurt you."

"Vic... Of course. I know you would never hurt me. Not in any non-consensual way, at least," she says, winking.

"Honey, I'm serious."

"I, I am too."

I can smell her beginning to sweat under her coat.

"Oh. Okay."

"I was thinking maybe you could, you know..."

I can't help but stare at what little I can see of her neck under her coat. Her skin is so flushed.

"Yeah, I got that, Laura. I don't know. It feels dangerous, I can't risk losing control."

"I mean, it's not like I would complain..."

I can hear her heart.

"Baby."

"Ok, yeah, I know what you mean. Listen, how about we come up with a safeword or something like that?"

"Alright, I think that could work."

"Perfe—"

"You have to promise me though. You have to promise you'll stop me, even if it means slapping me or something like that."

"I promise."

The deep brown of her eyes makes such a gorgeous contrast against the snow. I put my hand on her thigh and I kiss her, softly. She's so warm against my cold lips. 

---

I stare into her. She stares into me.

---

I pounce and my fangs are in her artery. Her blood like thick sap pours down my throat, coating the sides in iron and my head is full of suns. I feel her breath leave her lungs in a moan and all her muscles go tense then soft and she collapses into me and I cradle her in my arms, holding her head up. She moves then, drawing me into her as much as she can. The pit in my gut is finally contracting.

I drink,

and drink,

and drink,

but.

It's been too long. My fangs catch for a moment. My stomach and my head and my heart are roaring, but,

I pull away. Laura's skin is so pale. Her eyes are just barely open. For a moment they seem empty and I flash back to that green-eyes woman, lying in that alley. That moment lasts forever. I could swear my heart began to beat again.

"Laura, honey, please, please." I'm almost screaming. It's far too hot. There's too much around us. I can't. I slap her face and her eyes turn towards me. She struggles, but she focuses on me.

"Why... Why did you stop?"

The question doesn't even make its way in. Tears are streaming down my face and I hold her head to my chest.

"Fuck, don't do that to me, ever again, please. I— I can't— I just can't."

It comes again. "Why did you stop?" Her voice pierces my skull. I can't make sense of it.

"What do you mean? I almost lost you, you almost died, Laura. I almost didn't stop."

"It felt... so good." Her eyelids flicker.

I look into her again. She stares back into me, pleading.

"Laura."

"You didn't tell me how good it would feel."

"Laura you almost died. You promised me" 

"I... I know. It's just... It felt so good to just... drift away, to feel so empty." 

"Laura..."

I hold her close again. She's all around me, in her pillows, and her smell, and her warmth, and it all feels so suffocating. She puts her forehead to mine and stares into me, and,

I can't bare to stare back into her.
