# Into the Breach

Knowing what an enemy will do reduces some uncertainty, but really very little
Allows you to chain enemies into attacking each other
Great opportunity for combos
Also great opportunity fro you to mess yourself up tho

Idea of timelines instead of quitting/restarting...
Vague encouragement to restart where normally that would be frowned upon

## Challenge

### Uncertainty & Strategies vs. Tactics
Doesn't feel very **uncertain/strategic** to me, even though I know it's present

**Uncertainty** in game:
- Enemy behaviour
	- Spawn locations
	- Overall strategy
- Runs
	- Rewards given
	- Win conditions
	- Map layout

Overall though, the game felt extremely **focused on the current move**, which is very much **tactics** and made known to the player. I would imagine that over time, a shift in thinking of strategies would occur, which would deal far more with the uncertainties listed above.

My initial experience probably impacted by **difficulty**, I felt constantly in survival mode because of the **power** and the buildings. Kind of like a state of **flow**. Helped bvy win condition, goal, not being kill all the Vek but just survive long enough, damage to power not getting reset

All of this seems like it would make the game well-fitted for **longevity**.

Ok maybe tactics with little strategy is bad, I don't destroy Vek much and now I'm in a match with way too many attakcs to deal with

### Skills
- Assessing a situation
- Planning
- Strategy & tactics
- Adaptability
- Prioritization

### Lens of uncertainty
ItB felt like it contained mostly uncertainty of **perception and complexity, some performance**. If I did badly, it didn't feel like I had a bad **strategy or tactics**, it was more that I failed to foresee the consequences of an action. This felt encouraged by being able to see an *attack ahead, bumping people*, etc.

### Progression, Costs, & Rewards
Cost of stress, feeling like you'll lose, actually losing, embarrassing early perception mistakes
No cost of having to repeat same part of the game over and over again, islands can be played in any order
Reducing uncertainty of enemy types, conditions, special thingies
Gaining XP for characters (small boost), Learning, etc.

## Narrative
Ultimately, there's just no story beats, no progression, no arcs, just flavour text

### Embedded
not really present

Small throwaway lines here and there, purpose of islands and leaders
But no progression, therefore no story.

### Emergent
very lightly present

Pilots have names and are therefore different characters one *could* grow attached to (like FTL!), but...

- No choice
	- Role (mech)
		- (In FTL characters could go to different stations if need be, progression)
	- Creation
		- Looks
		- Exception: name, but only after game starts
	- They're in mechs
		- You don't control them directly
			- Nullifies impact of progression
		- You don't see them
			- Nullifies impact of portraits
			- Nullifies impact of dialogue

## Fiction
Initial framing of: the world has ended, time to go back in time and try again seems to reinforce difficulty level

### Game feel (Sensory)
Mostly **polish**
INSERT OBSERVATIONS FROM GAME HERE

Although, design of **board** make it feel like a tabletop game or diorama which adds back in some **spatial simulation** vibes. It definitely doesn't feel like I'm moving them around myself, but it feels like I'm controlling tiny little guys instead of abstract game stuff
Reminiscent of Link's Awakening remake, That pokemon toy game,
