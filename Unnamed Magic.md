# Unnamed Magic
### Aurora Becerra Granados

Plum ink pours out of the veins in my wrist and into the page's fibres. It's been weeks since I heard my name fall out of your mouth. 
"I really did want this."
It knocked me to the ground and I had to tear the phone from my cheek. I prayed that my tears and gulps of air couldn't cross the invisible phone line. It's been months since your smell faded from my pillow. And still
Its power over me lingers. A spell cast in spit and dead jasmine. It grinds my skin down into the road, the asphalt and my vocal cords singing in harmony. The thinned jade on my wrist refuses to snap.

You're telling me about the yarn you've been spinning recently as we sit opposite each other in the booth. It's one of those breakfast chains with a pun for a name. My thighs are sweating against the fake plastic because I just had to wear a skirt and the potatoes are under seasoned. The only thing I retain from that moment though is your foot ever so slightly rubbing against mine under the table. I couldn't for the life of me remember what I was talking about, so I asked you about what you do when you're not writing about Robin Hood for school and you tell me about your merino wool. It takes a long time before you have enough to knit anything, but you enjoy the process. Also, you're pretty sure you'd be drowning in sweaters and scarves otherwise. I'm not sure if that's the best connective tissue for the scene, but

Avoiding the task at hand, I desperately try to arrange the blankets on my bed without moving my head too much. The vertigo is fading, but my head still swims if I move it too quickly. It's probably not incredible for my recovery for me to be up so late, but I only have a few songs left to remove from the playlist and there's "nothing quite so poison as a promise" (Case, Hell On). I wish I had thought to move the jasmine into my room, but instead they died on the kitchen table, looking down onto the street below. Once I finish the playlist, I'll do my best to find you there, but as of yet, I still haven't found the words to describe what you smelled like.

We turned my computer off because it's right around the time you would usually go to sleep. But instead of getting up, we're just lying with my left arm awkwardly pressed against my chest and your face against mine. Your cheeks and the jasmine are pushing through my skull and I wonder if I should kiss you. The first of many on those pink sheets. But I didn't.

Luka asked me today if we could stand outside on the balcony before going to bed. I bring Nicole out with us. My foot hesitates before landing on the rough dusty ground three stories up. Luka, as little ones do, charges on. We're staring at the few stars that make it past our glow when she says that "when she wants a garden, you give her a rose" (Dollanganger, Whispering Glades). I think to myself that I should record this in my notebook and I remember watching you ask Luka for his name, still raw in the centre. Do you remember what mine tasted like falling out of your mouth? 

The next day, I pull out my plum pen to write it down. I embed the pages with your spit, the jasmine, and the piece of yarn you'll give me. I turn the spell over in my hands, the cuts stinging as I'm mixed into the dough. I check my phone and realize you've been waiting outside the restaurant while I've been waiting inside, and I nervously come out to see you for the first time.
