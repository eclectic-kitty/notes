# Week 4

## Week 3 wrap up

### Definition
**Semiotics**: study of language systems
sign
**Mimesis**: represeantation, imitations, ex. a play is the mimetic representation of the _diegesis_, the story world
**Event**: a change of state in the storyworld
**Agent**: anything or anyone within the diegesis that has the capacity to change the storyworld, bystanders aren't agents

### Too Late to Love You
Everything is a signifier
Ex. blue shape connotates a dress, shoulder pads, flowing
connotates a special occasion, fancy, dramatic, 

movement of ceiling coming up is denoting the ceiling coming up
connotations
opening up, shift in atmosphere, surrealism

round white shape moving _denotes_ a moon, a passage of time, movement
_connotes_ a timelessness, a fuzzy perspective of time, stuck

audio, denotes a performance
denotates 80's aesthetic
connotes wistfulness (also chords app! moving between similar chords)

non-diegetic elements: text, cursor
ceiling is diegetic as it is in the storyworld even if it's not necessarily *real*

## History
**60's/70's**: focus on ludic (game) elements. Eg: Spacewar and Pong
Some setting, but v slight
still v niche
**70's/80's**: Adventure Games and Interactive Fiction. Eg: Donkey Kong, Colossal Cave Adventure
Not like this was the only thing, but more story-based games began to appear
**80's/90's**: Further development of adventure games and roleplaying games. Eg. Dragon Slayer, Final Fantasy
Appearance of some cinematic elements at end, into 00's
**00's**: Dense ecology many story-based (and not) genres and games
Becoming a major genre/form, even overtaking or matching some as TV

## VG Narratology

Terms:
**Gameworlds**: Physical or virtual structures, describable w/ geometry or topology
**Storyworld**: Partially imagined storyworld
Rarely separate

**Ludic space**: Arena of gameplay
**Extra-ludic**: non-gameplay spaces
Ex. playable areas vs cutscenes

### Perspective
In literature, related to the voice of the speaker/writer
1st: I
2md: you
3d: they

In videogames, related to the perspective of of the player
1st person: pov of the character, etc.
2nd person: perspective of another character (rare) Eg. racing games? museum in KRZ

### Time
**Story time**: chronological ordering of events, including time that is implied
**Discourse Time**: literature only, how events are ordered to the audience
order, duration, frequency
**Operation time**: video games only, how events are presented to the audience, driven by player's actions and the game's autonomous mechanisms

#### Elements of discourse/operation time
**Order**: Sequencing of events
**Frequency**: How often a story event is presented in the discourse, or in games, operation
ex. murder mystery, seeing the murder again
**Duration**: Length of events

Ex. ABCDBD
Eacah letter being a different event

#### Elements of duration
**Speed**:
**Summary**: when duration of an event in operational time is shorter than in story time. Eg. aging
**Stretch**: When an event takes longer to happen in the operational time than it does in story time. Eg. Bullet time
**Pause**: When story time is paused so that the operation can do something else
Ex. pausing for choice, switching weapons

#### Fuzzy temporality
It is not possible to precisely fix the temporal position of an events in a timeline

### Space

#### 3 levels of space
**Topographical** (static): integrated into design process, organisation of the game's digital topography or layout
**Operational (also chronotopic)**: Topographical space combined with movements, pathways, directions
	- axes: principle pathways that lead to and away from major events, can be linear, don't have to change the ending (although that is a v clear example), but have to impact the main story
	- paths: branch out from axes. players can explore these, but they don't have major events
**Representational**: Space combined with verbal signs, audio, and visual signs to create symbolic world

### Characters
**Bots**
**Shallow**
**Deep**

### Apply terms to analysis
1. Understand and clearly define the terms
2. Apply the term to a case study to identify elements
3. Indicate how the term helps us better understand the operations od the story
4. Make an argument about why a better understanding of the story matters

Ex. from perspective (2nd person narration and 1st person perspective) leads to conflict between
