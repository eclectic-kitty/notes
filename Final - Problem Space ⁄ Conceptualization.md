# Final - Problem Space ⁄ Conceptualization

## From brainstorming:
- Struggling to remember recipes, remember modifications, come up with what to make
	- both self-developed and learned
	- remembering ingredients, recipe details
	- remembering a roster of recipes
- Quick research from other sites
	- A unique thing I can offer: Simplicity?
		- A lot of cooking apps have extra social / recommendation features
			- Uploading recipes
			- Seeing others' recipes
		- Problems with this
			- Paralysing choice
			- Upkeep of servers & reason to charge money
			- Clutter
		- Ultimately this could just be its own separate services
			- Could just allow for copyign recipes over from elsewhere

## Problem space
Wanting a little bit of help around the kitchen,
specifically with regards to:
- Figuring out what to make
	- Remembering recipes I've made in the past & enjoyed
	- cross-referencing with ingredients I have
- Developing recipes
	- Keeping track of modifications
		- substitutions
		- changes in amounts
		- added ingredients
		- brands
		- Graphs?
	- Thoughts on different variations

What do I not want?
- I don't need another place to find recipes, plenty of those already

Who is this app for?
- People who *enjoy* cooking
- People who enjoy tinkering with things, perfecting things
- Nerds!

## Existing options

### Recipe Keeper
Seems to have a lot of the features I want
- lack of suggestions
- Converting quantities

Features I hadn't thought about!
- checklist for ingredients
- tapping on a step to highlight it
- photo gallery

A little confusing that there's tabs on the top and bottom?

Recipe viewing thots
- I love the checklist, but it's a bit hard to press as it's just tapping on the text and it's very small
- That being said, it works way better for the directions, as each step is separated + they're multiple lines to begin with.
- I like that the quantities are bolded, called attention to
- I like that changing the quantity you're making is in the serving size section of the recipe, makes sense
	- once again tho, very small button
	- I don't love it being the most buttony thing on the recipe itself though, I do like the cimplicity of having it be in the toolbar up top
- Don't think the photo should be so big, not sure I even want photos tbh?
	- maybe just in notes, such as what colour something should be at a given point in cooking
- I don't think I would want a nutrition section?
- The overall look is a bit bland too tbh, just v directly sticking to android conventions (which look dated now) and I don't personally like orange
- share button?

Recipe editing/creating thots
- Don't love that the ingredients are just presented as a plain text list!
	- Doesn't allow to convert from one measurement to another
	- Understandably tho, what I'm imagining is probs more complex, so could give the two options
- I like the tags! Uncertain if different sections for categories and courses is necessary?
	- The cloud of tags feels like a good way of communicating that you can use multiple I think
	- Not sure I need both the "add new" and the plus? Or am I being over-minimalist
- I like the separation into overview, ingredients, directions, notes, photos
	- Again, do I want photos or just as part of the notes?
- maybe instead of x-y things, I could do x things +- y
- Directions
	- unclear how the directions section is another plain text box, but it does separate things based on lines (should be clearer that it's doing this I think)
	- I think I would want an option to either format yourself or let it do the formatting for you but be more obvious about it.
- Don't like the three dot menu that is used exclusively to lead you to an interface that allows you to modify the tags
	- This screen is also not incredible, just giving u a list, you have to click on a pencil to edit, and it's only there that you can delete
	- **to do** contrast with the spotify "edit playlist" screen

### Paprika
side hamburger menu instead of tabs.
Less immediately noticeable what's going on?
But perhaps also simpler off the bat, less intimidating
Message encouraging me to browse or make a new one!
sorting at the bottom is def weird tho

A-ha! browse button leads to an online amalgamation of various sites
Potentially warming up to the idea of having a starting type, particularly it being outside of app
I do think an import function is useful

creating a new recipe
- Again, a bit more simple, one screen instead of many tabs!
- Rating again!

grocery list
- simple text box to enter ingredients
- automatic detection for quantities
	- quantities appear as slightly smaller gray text!
- checklist system
- separated by iasle/section
- editing pop up
	- no delete button in edit page feels a little confusing
- long press, delete button apears in toolbar
	- able to delete many times quickly!
- toolbar
	- three dot menu in corener, clear, move to pantry(?), print, email
		- print and email feel like they could bve grouped in a share button?
	- search button
	- list selector arrow
	- list name
- at bottom, filters and sort by selector
	- the sort by selector includes per recipe? doesn't seem super well implemented? not sure what it means? is it list?
		- turns out it's not the list...
		- apparently it comes from when u add ingredients from a recipe
		- wish you could change what recipe something is in from the grocery list screen
	- same as on recipe list!
