# Final - Problem Space ⁄ Conceptualization

## From brainstorming:
- Struggling to remember recipes, remember modifications, come up with what to make
	- both self-developed and learned
	- remembering ingredients, recipe details
	- remembering a roster of recipes
- Quick research from other sites
	- A unique thing I can offer: Simplicity?
		- A lot of cooking apps have extra social / recommendation features
			- Uploading recipes
			- Seeing others' recipes
		- Problems with this
			- Paralysing choice
			- Upkeep of servers & reason to charge money
			- Clutter
		- Ultimately this could just be its own separate services
			- Could just allow for copyign recipes over from elsewhere

## Problem space
Wanting a little bit of help around the kitchen,
specifically with regards to:
- Developing recipes
	- Keeping track of modifications
		- substitutions
		- changes in amounts
		- added ingredients
		- brands
		- Graphs?
	- Thoughts on different variations
- Figuring out what to make
	- Remembering recipes I've made in the past & enjoyed
	- cross-referencing with ingredients I have

What do I not want?
- I don't need another place to find recipes, plenty of those already

Who is this app for?
- People who *enjoy* cooking
- People who enjoy tinkering with things, perfecting things
- Nerds!

## Existing options

### Recipe Keeper
Seems to have a lot of the features I want
- lack of suggestions
- Converting quantities

Features I hadn't thought about!
- checklist for ingredients
- tapping on a step to highlight it
- photo gallery

A little confusing that there's tabs on the top and bottom?

Recipe viewing thots
- I love the checklist, but it's a bit hard to press as it's just tapping on the text and it's very small
- That being said, it works way better for the directions, as each step is separated + they're multiple lines to begin with.
- I like that the quantities are bolded, called attention to
- I like that changing the quantity you're making is in the serving size section of the recipe, makes sense
	- once again tho, very small button
	- I don't love it being the most buttony thing on the recipe itself though, I do like the simplicity of having it be in the toolbar up top
- Don't think the photo should be so big, not sure I even want photos tbh?
	- maybe just in notes, such as what colour something should be at a given point in cooking
- I don't think I would want a nutrition section?
- The overall look is a bit bland too tbh, just v directly sticking to android conventions (which look dated now) and I don't personally like orange
- share and edit buttons do seem v important
- bottom toolbar
	- don't know how i feel about buttons at top & toolbar
	- add to shopping list button
		- checklist to select which ones to add
		- select which list to add to
		- select all and unselect all button next to add button
	- add meal (planning)
		- change the name of dish for the plan, autofilled with recipe name
		- can alter serving size? Does this seem necessary?
	- print!
		- Do people use it that much?
	- favourites button
		- hmmmm every other button takes you to a menu of some kind...
	- type size
	- a 3 button menu with pin, link, add to cookbook, duplicate, delete
		- convert measurements
		- I feel like this should be with serving size
- Oh! You can highlight steps instead of checking them off, I kinda like this...

Recipe editing/creating thots
- Don't love that the ingredients are just presented as a plain text list!
	- Doesn't allow to convert from one measurement to another
	- Understandably tho, what I'm imagining is probs more complex, so could give the two options
- I like the tags! Uncertain if different sections for categories and courses is necessary?
	- The cloud of tags feels like a good way of communicating that you can use multiple I think
	- Not sure I need both the "add new" and the plus? Or am I being over-minimalist
- I like the separation into overview, ingredients, directions, notes, photos
	- Again, do I want photos or just as part of the notes?
- maybe instead of x-y things, I could do x things +- y
- Directions
	- unclear how the directions section is another plain text box, but it does separate things based on lines (should be clearer that it's doing this I think)
	- I think I would want an option to either format yourself or let it do the formatting for you but be more obvious about it.
- Don't like the three dot menu that is used exclusively to lead you to an interface that allows you to modify the tags
	- This screen is also not incredible, just giving u a list, you have to click on a pencil to edit, and it's only there that you can delete
	- **to do** contrast with the spotify "edit playlist" screen

### Paprika
side hamburger menu instead of tabs.
Less immediately noticeable what's going on?
But perhaps also simpler off the bat, less intimidating
Message encouraging me to browse or make a new one!
sorting at the bottom is def weird tho

A-ha! browse button leads to an online amalgamation of various sites
Potentially warming up to the idea of having a starting type, particularly it being outside of app
I do think an import function is useful

viewing a recipe
- separate tabs for ingredients and directions
	- Feels unnecessary because there is quite a bit of space, but I could see it being useful for larger recipes?
	- I do like prepping ingredients first and then cooking
	- but if the recipe instructions tell u when to specifically do that stuff, I think this would work far less well
- checklist for ingredients
	- above thing does allow these to be bigger and easier to tap out!
	- They're also struck through here which I think works really well
- top toolbar aand buttons at bottom again grrr
	- it's in the coreners tho../
	- timer!!!
		- nice that's it integrated and on the page, but also seems wasteful as most people have a clock app
	- pin button def doesn't seem necessary
	- grocery list button, meal planning, favourite, edit, 3 dots (duplicate, print, email, delete, share)
		- meal planning has you select date and type of meal, in two separate steps, which feels like it maybe takes too long and is overly simplistic
		- print in three dots I think makes sense tho
		
creating a new recipe
- Again, a bit more simple, one screen instead of many tabs!
- Rating again!

grocery list
- simple text box to enter ingredients
- automatic detection for quantities
	- quantities appear as slightly smaller gray text!
- checklist system
- separated by iasle/section
- editing pop up
	- no delete button in edit page feels a little confusing
- long press, delete button apears in toolbar
	- able to delete many times quickly!
- toolbar
	- three dot menu in corener, clear, move to pantry(?), print, email
		- print and email feel like they could bve grouped in a share button?
	- search button
	- list selector arrow
	- list name
- at bottom, filters and sort by selector
	- the sort by selector includes per recipe? doesn't seem super well implemented? not sure what it means? is it list?
		- turns out it's not the list...
		- apparently it comes from when u add ingredients from a recipe
		- wish you could change what recipe something is in from the grocery list screen
	- same as on recipe list!

Pantry feature to keep track of what ingredients u have...
- Kind of like this as it could help keep track of what u have...
	- Easier to figure out what you can make
	- Can keep track of ingredients you might otherwise forget
- Does create extra work to have to go in and set that something's out of stock...
- You can move things in here straight from the shopping list
- Doesn't get rid of duplicates, which could be annoying
- Overall I think this seems extraneous and more trouble than it's worth

Meal planner
- tabs for day, week, month
- colour coding for different meals
	- colours pop up in the month as little dots
	- word is coloured in weekly view
	- word is not coloured in the day view >:(
- You can add notes
	- they appear indistinguishable from recipes aside for italics...
	- they also have to be in one of the meal categories
- can add ingredients from a day, week, or even month to the grocery list!
	- maybe what I most like about the idea of a meal plan

### BigOven
Right off the bat, not a fan of the navigation tabs on top being scrollable...
I feel like if you're going to have tabs, they should only fill one screen

This is just my own little complaint that doesn't really impact my project at all but the front page being so ad-filled is annoying...
Also where are these other recipes coming from?
A separate tab for videos is also annoying, why not make it a filter when searching for recipes?
The editorials section with little tips is nice tho... Makes me think about adding videogamey-style tips to the splash screen...

Viewing recipes
- Overall interface
	- tabs again... although this time the main navigation tabs are gone!
	- I like that the photo fades into the top notification bar
	- Not sure about the action buttons being in the middle there... (share, fave, bookmark, add photos, print)
		- I understand *why* it's there, but it feels weird for it not to be at the top next to the three dots menu button or the back button
- Ingredients
	- very clear, alternating background colour for each ingredient
	- Does take up a fair bit of space...
	- length of recipe and serving size appear only on the ingredients list
		- not sure I like that the servings are modified with the rolling wheel interface, as in Paprika
		- I think I like the simple text entry (with the +/- buttons) from Recipe Keeper
- Directions
	- Just paragraphs of text, here formatted in numerical steps
	- This is fine!
	- I feel like I would appreciate being able to check off steps and having them slightly more separate
	- Easy to copy-paste text tho!
- Plus button
	- actions
		- v prominent...
		- add to folder, add note to recipe
		- add to grocery list
		- add to meal planner
	- Don't like that 1/4 actions is adding something to the recipe, instead of adding the recipe to things
	- Do like big prominent action button at bottom tho

It won't let me type in my own recipe without an account :'(

## More specific conceptualization, ie interface lessons from other apps
