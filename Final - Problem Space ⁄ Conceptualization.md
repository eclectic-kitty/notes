# Final - Problem Space ⁄ Conceptualization

## From brainstorming:
- Struggling to remember recipes, remember modifications, come up with what to make
	- both self-developed and learned
	- remembering ingredients, recipe details
	- remembering a roster of recipes
- Quick research from other sites
	- A unique thing I can offer: Simplicity?
		- A lot of cooking apps have extra social / recommendation features
			- Uploading recipes
			- Seeing others' recipes
		- Problems with this
			- Paralysing choice
			- Upkeep of servers & reason to charge money
			- Clutter
		- Ultimately this could just be its own separate services
			- Could just allow for copyign recipes over from elsewhere

## Problem space
Wanting a little bit of help around the kitchen,
specifically with regards to:
- Figuring out what to make
	- Remembering recipes I've made in the past & enjoyed
	- cross-referencing with ingredients I have
- Developing recipes
	- Keeping track of modifications
		- substitutions
		- changes in amounts
		- added ingredients
		- brands
		- Graphs?
	- Thoughts on different variations

What do I not want?
- I don't need another place to find recipes, plenty of those already

Who is this app for?
- People who *enjoy* cooking
- People who enjoy tinkering with things, perfecting things
- Nerds!

## Existing options

### Recipe Keeper
Seems to have a lot of the features I want
- lack of suggestions
- Converting quantities

Features I hadn't thought about!
- checklist for ingredients
- tapping on a step to highlight it
- photo gallery

A little confusing that there's tabs on the top and bottom?
