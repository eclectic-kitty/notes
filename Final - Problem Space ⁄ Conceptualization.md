# Final - Problem Space ⁄ Conceptualization

## From brainstorming:
- Struggling to remember recipes, remember modifications, come up with what to make
	- both self-developed and learned
	- remembering ingredients, recipe details
	- remembering a roster of recipes
- Quick research from other sites
	- A unique thing I can offer: Simplicity?
		- A lot of cooking apps have extra social / recommendation features
			- Uploading recipes
			- Seeing others' recipes
		- Problems with this
			- Paralysing choice
			- Upkeep of servers & reason to charge money
			- Clutter
		- Ultimately this could just be its own separate services
			- Could just allow for copyign recipes over from elsewhere

## Problem space
Wanting a little bit of help around the kitchen,
specifically with regards to:
- Figuring out what to make
	- Remembering recipes I've made in the past & enjoyed
	- cross-referencing with ingredients I have
- Developing recipes
	- Keeping track of modifications
		- substitutions
		- changes in amounts
		- added ingredients
		- brands
		- Graphs?
	- Thoughts on different variations

What do I not want?
- I don't need another place to find recipes, plenty of those already

Who is this app for?
- People who *enjoy* cooking
- People who enjoy tinkering with things, perfecting things
- Nerds!

## Existing options

### Recipe Keeper
Seems to have a lot of the features I want
- lack of suggestions
- Converting quantities

Features I hadn't thought about!
- checklist for ingredients
- tapping on a step to highlight it
- photo gallery

A little confusing that there's tabs on the top and bottom?


### Paprika
side hamburger menu instead of tabs.
Less immediately noticeable what's going on?
But perhaps also simpler off the bat, less intimidating
Message encouraging me to browse or make a new one!
sorting at the bottom is def weird tho

A-ha! browse button leads to an online amalgamation of various sites
Potentially warming up to the idea of having a starting type, particularly it being outside of app
I do think an import function is useful

creating a new recipe
- Again, a bit more simple, one screen instead of many tabs!
- Rating again!

grocery list
- simple text box to enter ingredients
- automatic detection for quantities
	- quantities appear as slightly smaller gray text!
- checklist system
- separated by iasle/section
- editing pop up
	- no delete button in edit page feels a little confusing
- long press, delete button apears in toolbar
	- able to delete many times quickly!
- toolbar
	- three dot menu in corener, clear, move to pantry(?), print, email
		- print and email feel like they could bve grouped in a share button?
	- search button
	- list selector arrow
	- list name
- at bottom, filters and sort by selector
	- the sort by selector includes per recipe? doesn't seem super well implemented? not sure what it means? is it list?
		- turns out it's not the list...
		- apparently it comes from when u add ingredients from a recipe
		- wish you could change what recipe something is in from the grocery list screen
	- same as on recipe list!
