## Exam

### Q1 - SCI
- Challenge-based
- Not narrative
	- There simply isn't much story to the game, more fiction
		- Sure there's a reason why we're fighting these aliens, there's people to protect, characters, etc.
			- This is fiction though, flavour text
	- There's no questions beyond basic will I succeed?
		- There is no progression, no arcs
			- Characters don't change, there are no narrative twists and turns / beats
		- There is nothing to interpret
- Not sensory
	- Some fun sensory elements
		- Board!
		- Look at my little guys
		- Endearing and nostalgic 8-bit aesthetic
	- Ultimately sensory elements more form than function
		- In-game music is atmospheric, more in the background
		- Colours are there to make game elements identifiable, stand out
		- Even the board I like so much is ultimately there to ensure tiles are discrete, identifiable
	- No game feel according to Steve Swink
		- Mostly polish (some fiction and representation)
		- not real-time
		- no spatial simulation


### Q2 - Two skills
- Prioritization
	- The game presents you with multiple goals, and makes it impossible to achieve each one
		- This is due to difficulty, constantly being on survival mode
		- one must be able to figure out what they can afford to sacrifice and what goal will give them the best chance of finishing the game, if achieved
- Assessment
	- The game encourages the player to make a full assessment of the situation
		- The game provides infinite time to make this assessment
		- Furthermore, the game provides plenty of information with which to assess the best solution
		- Finally, the game makes this challenging due to complexity of turns and consequences
			- amount of enemies
			- pushing
			- blocking
			- status effects

### Q3 - Reward types & motivation
- Intrinsic rewards I found somewhat motivating but not that much
	- reputation points -> upgrades -> weapons or reactor cores (these latter ones are v fun too though)
	- unlocking new mechs, pilots, islands, situations
- Extrinsic rewards I found much more motivating
	- Simply surviving and progressing through the game
	- It feels so difficult & punishing that it felt like a real achievement to complete all the missions, get to the end of the level, even just survive, etc.

### Q4 - Chance in Into the Breach
- NOT IN YET: Talking about formal elements of chance games and how they just don't *feel* present in Breach

### Q5

### Q6 - Puzzle game?
- No
	- Simply put, people generally agree that puzzles have a "solution" a single right answer
	- There might be a dominant strategy for Breach someone (or a computer) could figure out,
	- but very few people experience the game that way
- , but...
	- It **is** a very thinky game
	- The player is given all the time they need to do decide on their move
		- There is no element of reflexes or physical skill
	- The player is told all the immediate consequences of their actions
	- It feels like a puzzle, I very much play as if I;m trying to figure out the best move I can make, 
	- Ubisoft types of skill kind of makes sense to me, seeing puzzles aas being ultimate mental skill. Not all the way there because of complexity and unknowns meaning there is no solution, but I still approach it similarly and with mental skill

### Q7 - How is the game designed to make players sacrifice?
- Difficulty level is generally very high
	- Veks have a high amount of health
		- Compared to damage level
	- One is often outnumbered by Veks
	- Many vulnerabilities
- Different goals / priorities
	- Power grid health
	- Health of mechs / pilots
	- Missions
	- Killing Veks
	- Getting to end of level
- Dynamics b/ goals
	- Killing Veks can prevent them from damaging mechs or power grid
		- However, killing Veks is not the **only** way of preventing them from damaging stuff
			- Pushing mechanic is sometimes a much better tactic
				- Sometimes it simply gets more done
					- (Veks on adjacent sides of a single building, missile mech can push them to the side)
				- Sometimes it actively makes it that you might damage your stuff by attacking Veks directly
			- Blocking mechanic is another way to prevent more Veks from being on the board
				- can't take advantage if Vek dies
		- (Veks seem to prioritize attacking grid over player)
			- This can mean that putting mechs in Veks' attack path is often a good tactic
	- Killing Veks is also often not one of the missions
		- It'll keep you from being attacked, but you won't be able to upgrade if you don't complete missions
			- (Some missions have you specifically not )
		- If you can't upgrade, you won't be able to protect yourself later
	- Finally, one doesn't need to kill Veks to win level, one only needs to get to the end
- Lastly, knowing the attacks of each turn gives you all the immediate information, allowing one to make a semi-informed choice of what they can afford to sacrifice or not, encouraging players to make riskier decisions that *will* have negative consequences
	- As opposed to something like XCOM where there's fog of war, probabilities, generally more chance.
	- This encourages some players (me) to hedge their bets as they can't be sure sacrifices will be manageable

### Q8 - Loops
- Venti Loop: Finishing a game / dying, choosing a pilot to pass on
- Grande Loop: Finishing islands, upgrading one's stuff,
- Mezzo Loop: Finishing individual levels, choosing next level, choosing abilities
- Piccolo Loop: Finishing a turn
