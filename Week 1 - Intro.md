No way to know how it was read 2000 years ago
Can't know "**idiomatic**" references in the language

No. 2 might just be a paragraph
No. 3 could be in point form
After that, all essays

Everything in hard copy, can leave in mailbox at office

kiddeshot?
khi?
some kind of undefined role for women in the temple
often powerless
