# Week 1

## Warm-up exercises
I'm creative in how I dress, how I decorate and adorn my self and its many extensions. The hex codes of the colours in this application, the stickers all over my water bottle, pill bottle, laptop, shelves, the pictures on my wall. I'm creative when I'm overflowing, either with energy or emotion, It bursts through my hands in the spacing of pictures or emotions come words. It's painstakingly slow, every character or milimeter considered. 

I want to learn how to pour out bits of myself in a more measured manner. The in between in which I feel even a little bit emptier makes it so much more difficult for the energy and emotion to spill out. This difficulty then drains me even further and I feel uncreative for days come weeks. 

I want to learn ways to think about my creativity that let me focus on getting things out first in order to rearrange and consider the details later.

## Readings

### Skimming Poetry Is Not a Luxury

I like the idea of poetry / light as colouring our life and helping bring shape to what we think of it, reminds me of lighting a scene, how deep are the shadows? What tint does the world have to it? How does this affect us? the contrast between feelings coming from a dark place, a cellar, flourishing into light

single word: hopeful? emboldened? comforted? Reassured?

Community, helping to understand ourselves and how a reader can compare themself to this captured image in order to understand their self better

Rejecting headiness, rejecting fear and overthinking in favour of courage to feel, to live. Rejecting the need for progress to reject old knowledge and wisdom, to understand that we have the tools and ideas we need, we just need to articulate and act on them

"think therefore I am" rejects feeling

contrasting and unraveling binaries

Contrast between light and dark. The cold light of reason, that in its harshness obscures, versus the darkness that cultivates in its obscurity, allowing for a more thoughtful and feeling light to come forwards (reminds me of Hollow Knight, pale emperor, the shades, the radiance)

### Diving into the Wreck
word: haunt

mirroring, the ocean, a diver, looking for something
identity? creativity?
The structure mirrors the dive, you descend through it, lines are often short, near the bottom "This is the place"
The first few lines are more assured, before the descent, perparation, ritual
Further, past "I put on", there's more awkwardness, self-criticism, difficult to move in a diving suit
The ocean rejects us, the light fades away, it crushes us, 
"I go down, repeated, punctuates the stanza", creates an ominous feeling to the descent
Shifts between shorter straightforward lines, repeated almost as a mantra, vs more descriptive unsure lines
adulthood, putting myth and learning into practice
The mantras, the myth, the preparation, the mirroring of beginning and end, suggests ritual to me, diving down into the unknown
penultimate stanza talks of being rotted, destroyed, relates to leaving the known, obliterating themself to allow for transformation and communion (i am he, i am she, we are...)
a snake eating its own tail
the simpler sentences, the mantras, are like **ledges for readers to stand upon**
At the beginning the narrator is more doubtful, alone, but at the end they connect more, more assured, decentering, annihilating the self

## More writing exercises: poem! yay!(?)

If I'm not sure what to write, Make is and isn't statements

Art-making is not creation out of nothing
Art-making is magic
Find the true names of things
Play tricks with them
Make them read as something they are not
At its most powerful,
It is transformation
It requires annihilation
Broken-down piecemeal, rearrange the characters
Combine them with the names of other things

Combine them with your own name
Pull that tooth
Tear out your liver

## Readings

### Why Don't You Dance?

Icky!
Confused setting

Contrast between a new couple, looking to move in together, gather furniture
And a seemingly separated couple, a man ridding himself of that life, that setting, while not dismantling it, and inserting himself into the other couple's life

This author is known for being minimalist
Past the first page, there is nearly no description
Everything is relatively straightforward. But the way it fits together is off-kilter (similar to the furniture)

Introduced to the new couple without the man present, despite the knowledge that he must be here somewhere

There is a lack of interiority to the characters for the reader

Avoidance, loneliness, things going unsaid
The difficulty in making the interior exterior, the difficulty in putting a word to it

## Exercise

### Fiction

The fences, rusted and riddled with holes, stood far from the tracks, overgrown with moss. She climbs through a particularly large hole, unsure if a person cut it or if some confluence of weather and rust had bored through the fence.

"Are you sure the trains don't run anymore?"

The woman considers the mulch in between the rails. Orange light bathed the grass and shone off them. She hoped the sun would set soon.
