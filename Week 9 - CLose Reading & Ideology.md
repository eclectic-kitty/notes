## Interpellation

### Ideology
A set of system of beliefs, ideas, or principles
(v simplified!)

Often applied to politics!
green vs conservative party
Also structures
capitalism

Marx
Big idea:
We best understand our material conditions (history and society) by examining the structures of economic relations
(again, v simplified!)

### Individual vs. subject
Individual:
Refers to a single, distinct, human being

SUbject:
A recognized member of a system (a nation, a queen, an entire political system)

One might say we are born individuals, and then become subjects

### Interpellation and hailing
Calling an individual into a set of ideas, into a subject position

Individual that puts out the call, the hail, sets the parameters of the relation
This process appears organic and naturalized to the individual, appears inescapable, involuntary

Individuals don't have rights, subjects do

### Police example
"Hey you!"

Relation is shaped by logic of the state, where the officer has pwoer to enact force on behalf of the state

Relation is foregrounded or emphasized in call, whether the subject responds or not

### Baby
Before it is even born, it is interpellated, within the societal framework of gender

Not just physiological, but also a category in positions of poer, patriarchy

### In arts
The art object is the system interpellating the audience
By engaging with it, one becomes interpellated into the ideologies of the art object

In entering the world, one is positioned in relation to it by its storyworld and mechanical ideologies
