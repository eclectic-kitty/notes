## freewriting
If we **frame** home as a "shelter for dreaming",
what does home mean to me?

```
In terms of rest, my home certainly lines up well with my house. 
There are few places where I feel more at peace than simply in my bed or at my computer. 
It is a space I have curated, full of pieces of me. 
Even my computer I built myself (not the most intense thing, but it's something)

People also fit into this very well
My family, including those not related by blood. Ultimately, they're even more important. 
Physical comfort, allowing myself to simply be in the present with those I love. 
Here we also begin to get into my creativity and imagination. 
When working with other people I often feel the most motivated to work, to dream, and to think. 
People to bounce ideas off of, to push me to be more exact.

The music I love also feels like home to some extent.
