# Prompt 4 - Citations

Information is all around us and comes in many forms, from many sources. Citations are one way of narrowing in on the information we choose to focus on. Citing sources is good scholarly practice, and, as you may remember from Tamara Lee’s talk on The Argonauts last semester, it can also be a creative practice that gestures towards wider webs of influence and care. As such, for this prompt you will narrow in on two sources of information for your final project: a more conventional source and a more creative source. 1. Conventional source: select one source of information for your final project — this can be a book, a chapter, a website, an article, a meme, a zine, a performance, etc. Cite the source according to Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. In one sentence, explain what information this source will provide towards your final project. 2. Creative source: consider other sources of information that inform your practice — this can be an embodied experience of working with your materials, a good walk or nap that provides clarity, a failure that prompts redirection or starting again, the way light or sound changes in a particular setting. Select one “source” to describe, and, in one sentence, explain what information it provides towards your final project.
