# Album Thots - Sprained Ankle

## Paragraph
Sprained Ankle is, at surface level, a rather simple singer-songwriter record. All of the songs but one feature only Julien Baker singing by herself, accompanied by acoustic guitar, electric guitar, or piano. The original visual design reflects this simplicity, utilising a washed out monochrome blue photo of Julien, accompanied by small all-caps sans-serif type in grey and white. While the design's coldness does a great job in representing the stark instrumentals and heartbreaking lyrics, I find the simple imagery a tad uninspired. Many of the songs touch on varied forms of absence (of faith, of loved ones, of a sense of self-worth) and feature often viscerally blunt imagery ("But I can't go to bed without drawing the red, shaving off breaths / Each one so heavy, each one so cumbersome"). These are some of the elements I hope to bring out more in my redesign of the album's covers, as well as the record's ultimately comforting nature, that of cathartically sharing your pain with someone else who understands.

## Existing Sleeve
Very simple and minimalist overall, monochrome
Absolutely conveys the record's lonely cold little mood
I'd probably stick somewhere within these vibes, at least the colour scheme
Minimalism leaves a lot of focus on Julien
As much as I feel like it could do more, def feel like it's going for a "this is a singer-songwriter record" kinda vibe, which is not a bad thing!

### Colours
Entirely just shades of light blue
Barely even any straight up white on the cover, just the title
Def no black
Love the minimalism here, not just sticking to one colour, but even leaving out black and white (mostly)

I wish the back weren't white, but the gray font helps keep it similar enough

disc label is minimal and a bit too focused on the record label for me, but love that the colour scheme matches

Lyric sheet does end up looking a bit incomplete tho
black and white, none of that gorgeous slightly green blue
Drawing is v nice but has a little too much colour for my taste
Those toes are impressive tho, props to julien!

### Typography
Slanted (italics?), all caps, sans-serif, modern
Like the use of different weights on the font to differentiate title and artist
Single font used throughout material
Literally no small letters

### Themes / images I could focus on
Cuerpos, abject
Decomposition
Ghosts, absence, of people, of faith
Noise, snow
luz, a shoulder to cry on, holiness

Something more fleshy, something more noisy, something with a light, somethign with sheets
