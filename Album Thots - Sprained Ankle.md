# Album Thots - Sprained Ankle

## Existing Sleeve
Very simple and minimalist overall, monochrome
Absolutely conveys the record's lonely cold little mood
I'd probably stick somewhere within these vibes, at least the colour scheme
Minimalism leaves a lot of focus on Julien
As much as I feel like it could do more, def feel like it's going for a "this is a singer-songwriter record" kinda vibe, which is not a bad thing!

### Colours
Entirely just shades of light blue
Barely even any straight up white on the cover, just the title
Def no black
Love the minimalism here, not just sticking to one colour, but even leaving out black and white (mostly)

I wish the back weren't white, but the gray font helps keep it similar enough

disc label is minimal and a bit too focused on the record label for me, but love that the colour scheme matches

Lyric sheet does end up looking a bit incomplete tho
black and white, none of that gorgeous slightly green blue
Drawing is v nice but has a little too much colour for my taste
Those toes are impressive tho, props to julien!

### Typography
Slanted (italics?), all caps, sans-serif, modern
Like the use of different weights on the font to differentiate title and artist
Single font used throughout material
Literally no small letters

### Themes / images I could focus on
Cuerpos, abject
Decomposition
Ghosts, absence, of people, of faith
Noise, snow
luz, a shoulder to cry on, holiness

Something more fleshy, something more noisy, something with a light, somethign with sheets
