# Week 2

### Benshoff - homosexuality, horror
- Threat to the individual
- others
- community, culture


Homosexuality was a screen upon which other societal fears could be projected
- cold war era paranoia
- social fabric
- morality
- nuclear family

### Waldron
queerness is less about the person being evil,
and more about a general societal concern
not this person is evil, but
something is wrong here, unpleasant, 

If you represent a monster, bad person as queer, or the queer people as disposable
You tell the audience something
You are also reinforcing this idea

## what makes the experience of a horror movie queer?
None of the following characteristics are necessary, or necessarily make a film queer, 
- Does the film contain identifiably queer characters?
- Is it written, produced, or directed by a queer person?
- most importantly, there is a subtextual or connotative queer element?
- for Doty, any film viewed by a queer spectator could be considered queer, as they bring their queerness into the film

homonormativity
homosexuality that can fit into a heteronormative structure

## Hays code
timeline
- introduced in 1930
- enforced by 1934
- ignored by 1968

Things had to either not be presented, or if they were, the characters had to be punished by the narrative

There was something she saidi about queerness that was interesting

While in effect, the only queer characters that really existed were hinted at

Until today, bad people are shown to exhibit deviant sexual behaviour

## Robin Wood's horror formula
Normality, monster, relationship between

- church
- suburban family
- heterosexual couple
it's boring

monster
- fantastic
- etc.


## How to analyse films reminder
look closely at everything presented
story, themes?
(conflicts, perspective, what happens, how ending, changes)
Why?

beyond story,
lighting, colour, camera angles, music, sound, dialogue, performance
what is intended?
what is perceived?

assume every choice is deliberate
even if you don't like it, or don't think it's effective
why was it chosen?

"Decent people don't like this sort of stuff"
Legion of Decency

If everything is suggested and nothing is explicit,
how come the legion can see it?

Lili was not allowed to be topless
it immediately cuts to the hospital to make it clear nothing lesbian happened

Erwin - horror of this period used doctors, specifically psychiatrists, to paint mosters as threatening. queerness = mental illness, thus psychiatrist attempts to cure the monster

(Halloween!!)

Freud is popular, everyone is invested in science, psychology as the solution

Foucault: sexuality was understood to be far more fluid, less tied to identity throughout much of human history,
until 18th century, rise of scientific and medical institutions, categorization
this person *did* this thing vs. this person *is* this thing

queerness, monstrousness, is to be feared, and pitied. they should be destroyed physically, emotionally, or mentally

## Cat People
Produced for RKO Pictures
story of Irena Dubrovina,
newly marries, serbian,
descended from an ancient trube of cat people
metamorphose into panthers when aroused

### Val Lewton
Straight man, but,
grew up around queerness
aunt (Alla Nazimova), parties in the backyard

### Marriage
husband is very American, very normal
Alice: coworker of his, both architects

clip:
Same afternoon they meet, after meeting via negging,
The guy is telling her he loves her, bemoaning that they've never kissed
She immediately feels bad when this is mentioned
"lived in dread of this moment"

"That has nothing to do with you, you're in america"

Oliver is the whitest most normalest boy
"You know, I've never been unhappy before, things have always gone swell for me"
Said by Oliver to Alice

### Issues
Hot af woman who calls her "sister" (reads as hitting on her)

Oliver confiding in Alice causes Irena to feel betrayed & jealous

she then turns into a cat and tries to stalk Alice,
only around this other woman is she a cat, 
and only when aroused is she meant to be a cat

### psychiatrist
Story is a product of her own fear
more charming, simpler too
Irena fear past, her the present
imagination v consience
do you thin I'm afraid of so charming a lady

He then tries to kiss jer
She says she doesn't want him to kiss her
he goes off about contest of wills, she's playing a game, enjoying this game, etc.
threatens to put her away for insanity
immediately gets closer to her, touches her
tells her to forget about her past, get rid of her cat interest

Hidden side = queerness
cat thing = queerness

double nature of a queer person is the dueling desires within

### Normality
Irena, foreign, wild, improper, etc.
Alice, is American, by contrast
Thus it ends with a heterosexual, valid couple

But, what about their adultery?
Is that not wrong?
The marriage is never consummated, never made legitimate, however
Further, there is something to be said for the appearance of normality and righteousness not needing to reflect the actual internal character (ex. current right wing people not really portraying family values)

## Disidentification
Bell Hooks' oppositional gaze
dilemma of marginalized people facing harmful representations
not looking can be a form of resistance against power structures

identifying with something, or rather with a version of something not quite presented to you
