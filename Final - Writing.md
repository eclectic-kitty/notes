# Final - Writing

## Introduction


## Married in Mount Airy
Dunno about the first sentence

*Married in Mount Airy*, the 2023 album by singer-songwriter Nicole Dollanganger, utilises degraded nostalgia in order to explore how we allow ourselves to haunt that which ultimately harms us. 

The album tells the story of a woman, who I will refer to as the Bride, and her initially dreamy relationship with a man who proves to be anything but. 

While the record begins by painting an idyllic picture of its central couple, as it progresses, the Husband's abusive and ultimately murderous tendencies become progressively clear. On the third song, *Dogwood*, the Bride describes some sort of substance abuse and a reckless, stubborn nature. By the album's midpoint, on *Moonlite*, the Husband has become controlling and abusive towards her. He drunkenly tells her he has her "mounted on a wall in the back of [his] mind" and that he fantasizes of either fucking her or outright killing her. Although her ultimate fate isn't clear, the album heavily hints at her ultimately dying by his hand.

Despite all the abuse, the Bride seems unable to pull herself away from him. On the aforementioned *Dogwood*, she prays for God to not let him die and denies his faults, telling God she "[refuses] to understand that he just makes his own bed". On *My Darling True* she seems to romanticize the abuse, saying she'd "love it so, If you'd hold me 'til I'm cold and blue".

While her fate isn't entirely clear, 

The first song, titled after the album, depicts the couple marrying at Mount Airy Lodge and "[making] love beneath the mirrored ceilings", although the song ultimately comes off as a romanticized memory. It's one of only two songs on the whole record written in the past tense. Furthermore, the Bride's recollection of details is fuzzy as she can't "recall what [they] were drinking", but that "there was **something** very strange in the air".


While presenting the only entirely positive moment for the couple, the opening track, *Married in Mount Airy*, already feels haunted. The first sound

The album's second song, *Gold Satin Dreamer*, portrays a still happy home life as the Bride sings of gold satin, summer barbecues, and relaxing baths. 

On the third track, *Dogwood*, the Bride sings of his substance abuse, but says that "there's no telling that man what to do". 

On *Runnin' Free*, the Husband has become neglectful, as the Bride pleads with him to not leave her alone, despite believing
