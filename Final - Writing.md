# Final - Writing

## Introduction


## Married in Mount Airy
Dunno about the first sentence

*Married in Mount Airy*, the 2023 album by singer-songwriter Nicole Dollanganger, utilises degraded nostalgia in order to explore how we allow ourselves to haunt that which ultimately harms us. 
to explore our attraction to that which is decaying or even harmful

The album tells the story of a woman, who I will refer to as the Bride, and her initially dreamy relationship with a man who proves to be anything but. 

While the record begins by painting an idyllic picture of its central couple, as it progresses, the Husband's abusive and ultimately murderous tendencies become progressively clear. On the third song, *Dogwood*, the Bride describes some sort of substance abuse and a reckless, stubborn nature. By the album's midpoint, on *Moonlite*, the Husband has become controlling and abusive towards her. He drunkenly tells her he has her "mounted on a wall in the back of [his] mind" and that he fantasizes of either fucking her or outright killing her. Although her ultimate fate isn't clear, the album heavily hints at her ultimately dying by his hand in the songs *Sometime After Midnight* and *Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus*.

Despite all the abuse, for the majority of the record, the Bride seems unable to pull herself away from him. On the aforementioned *Dogwood*, she prays for God to not let him die and denies his faults, telling God she "[refuses] to understand that he just makes his own bed". On *My Darling True* she seems to romanticize the abuse, saying she'd "love it so, If you'd hold me 'til I'm cold and blue." 

The way the album's central relationship is slowly revealed to be far from perfect is further reflected by the album's relationship with nostalgia. The most obvious example of this is the album's namesake, Mount Airy Lodge, a once famous honeymoon resort. It featured such romantic amenities such as heart shaped bathtubs and mirrored ceilings above the beds. For a few hundred dollars, countless couples were sold the image of perfect romance, despite this obviously being something that a fancy resort simply can't provide. Today, the resort is long gone. After a steady decline throughout the eighties and nineties, it eventually closed in 2001 and was later demolished.

An entirely romanticized view of nostalgia and relationships is not one the album presents though. Instead, the album takes a more hauntological approach. Hauntological art is described by Mark Fisher as work that is "suffused with an overwhelming melancholy" for a promised rosy future that will never come to pass. It's a sense that time has broken down. Ghosts make for a great metaphor for this as they are traces of people and traumatic events that break time in the way that they retain power and affect the present in their absence. 

in *Mount Airy*, the Bride is haunted by the love promised to her by her Husband, while the reality of her situation eats away at that promise. Representative of this is the album's opening title track, which depicts her marriage at Mount Airy Lodge. In some ways, this is the happiest moment on the entire record, but it's only a fading memory. The first thing heard on the track is a guitar that randomly shifts out of tune, as if it were being played on an old tape. The title track is also one of only two songs on the entire record written in the past tense. Indeed, the Bride can't "recall what [they] were drinking." She even references a famous 90's ad for the resort which featured the catchphrase "all you have to bring is your love of everything," but she says they were married in the sixties. This memory, in and of itself beginning to rot and increasingly melancholy, haunts the rest of the record


Not only is the album hauntological, but the Bride herself becomes a ghost. In the album's last full song, *Whispering Glades*, the Bride imagines her Husband's burial, finally able to see his true nature. Importantly, she describes the Husband "dead and buried with a smile painted on [his] face." On a metaphorical level, the Husband paints on his smile in order to deceive the women he abuses with a charming exterior, but on a literal level, his smile is painted on because he's dead; a mortician has given him this smile. At the end of the song, the Bride describes that unlike the other mourners, she'll have "a smile painted on [her] face." She too has died. 

Tragically though, ghosts don't get to move on. In the album's last track, an outro/interlude, the Bride has seemingly forgotten the abuse or her Husband's death, as she waits for him to call. After a few short verses, the song transitions into the same distorted guitar from the very first song. The Bride thus forever relives the events that led to her death, over and over again


The horror to come also seeps into the memory, as she remembers her Husband tasting bitter, like sherry, instead of maraschino cherries. 
Ultimately, her descriptions of being carried into their suite and "[making] love beneath the mirrored ceilings" , with its cold guitars soaked in reverb
