# Final - Writing I guessÊ”

## Writing!!! ðŸ˜±

I will utilize close reading techniques, informed by performance theory, to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth in the 2023 survival horror videogame *Alan Wake 2*, developed by Remedy Entertainment. *Alan Wake 2* focuses on the dual stories of its titular character, a tortured writer who has been trapped in a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place for over a decade, and Saga Anderson, an FBI detective pulled into Wake's horror story when she begins to investigate ritual murders seemingly related to Wake. 

Throughout the game, many of the characters' actions are compared to performances, especially rituals. A prime example is Alan's attempts to escape the Dark Place. His escape attempts consist of writing stories that form the basis for the game's events, s the Dark Place grants art reality-altering powers. Indeed, much like art in *AWII*, the most important differentiation between rituals and other kinds of performance is that rituals work to effect change, whereas other performances work to entertain (Schechner *An Introduction*, 159). More specifically, there's a type of ritual called a liminal ritual that seeks to effect or ease a transformation in the performer. Alan's writing and the game's events also ultimately serve to effect such a transformation in him. The primary antagonist throughout the game is Mr. Scratch, a personification of the unhealthy and antisocial aspects of his personality that he is transformed into when possessed by the Dark Place.

Another aspect of rituals that brings clarity to Alan's journey is the authority that rituals carry. Rituals, like other performances, have specific rules or script that differentiate them from one another. Unlike other performances though, these have neither an internal, nor a social source, but they come from a (usually divine) authority (Schechner, *Theory* 16). Throughout *AWII*, Alan similarly makes appeals to a set of rules: genre constraints. Specifically, he insists that in horror, every character is either a victim or a monster. As a result, these are the roles he writes every character, including himself, into, discarding the possibility of a happy ending for anyone. His deference goes even further, directly giving storytelling power and authority by declaring that "this story is a monster" and that it "will eat you alive". Returning to personal growth, the authority of ritual or genre conventions mirrors the authority of one's self-image. Self-destructive behaviours have a nasty habit of reinforcing themselves as committing such actions can cause one to believe that they are fundamentally a bad person. This belief, in turn, allows one to abdicate responsibility for those actions, as it is simply one's nature. This statement of belief grants itself authority and makes itself real, much like art in the Dark Place. Indeed, Alan initially believes that Scratch is an external entity, before learning it is a possessed version of himself. As he believes the story he is writing can only feature victims and monsters, he has written himself in as his own monster, preventing him from changing his behaviour and escaping the Dark Place.

The final aspect of rituals that I'll focus on is that despite the authority they carry, they are ultimately constructions, created by humans. Rituals are designed and changed overtime by practitioners or religious authorities in order to fit their needs (Schechner *Introduction* 160). Multiple characters in the game refer to the constraints Alan works under as self-imposed, his interpretation of how the storyworld works (storyworld is a narratological term that refers to the work's fictional universe). Ultimately, Alan is able to escape only by changing what he understands as the conventions of horror, or even storytelling itself. The first convention he breaks is that of the singular protagonist. This is central to much of western storytelling and canonized by Joseph Campbell's monomyth story structure, which centres around a singular protagonist and has been criticized for implying an individualistic world view (Bond). Contrary to the monomyth, *AWII* features two protagonists, Alan and Saga. While Saga helps Alan in break with the second convention I will cover, she is given her own full journey and allotted half of the game's playtime. The second convention Alan breaks with is the limitation of characters' roles to those of victim and monster. Thanks to Saga, he is able to realize that horror stories can also allow for heroes.

## Is anything missing?
- Explaining how Saga isn't a mere supporting character
	- Digging into her journey to assert herself and the fact that she is the hero of her own story
	- This is the main thing that causes Alan to accept that there are other perspectives, and that he must make changes to his own
- Establishing that Alan's writing process is a form of ritual
	- Citing examples of it being referred to as one
	- Stating that the common goal validates these comparisons

	- This article presents a series of criticisms of Joseph Campbell's monomyth, both with regards to Campbell's methodology and the truthfulness of his claims, as well as with regards to its implications on how stories are written and interpreted. 
- Campbell, Joseph. *The Hero With a Thousand Faces*. Commemorative ed., Princeton University Press, 2004.
	- This is the text in which Joseph Campbell puts forward his theory about stories having a consistent structure revolving around a central heroic protagonist (i.e. the "monomyth" or "hero's journey"). While I have many issues with it, it was a clear influence on Alan Wake II. That being said,it's lead writer, Sam Lake, has talked about using it only as a guiding structure and not as a direct blueprint. I am thus interested in examining the ways in which the game's story breaks with Campbell's structure and the thematic implications that come with it. I'm especially interested to see how this may line up with the extensive existing criticism of the monomyth, such as those in the article above.

	- This is a textbook on performance theory. It provides a lot of invaluable information on the various elements of rituals (and other types of performance) that help me analyze Alan Wake II through the lens of performance theory. It also provides many references to other work on the subject, which I imagine will prove useful in deepening my understanding of performance theory and the ideas it builds upon.

	- A book on performance theory by the same author as the textbook above. Useful for much of the same reasons as above, but seems to be a tad more in depth
