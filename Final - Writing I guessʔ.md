# Final - Writing I guessÊ”

## Outline
- topic
	- Use of ritual imagery
- clearly define key terms
	- see bolded words
-  case study
	- Alan Wake 2
- state your main argument(s)
	- The game invokes the concept of rituals to illuminate the process of personal growth
		- spiral as a nesting doll of rituals (ritualistically engaging in bad behaviour, recognising bad behaviour and source, working to change it, restarting, non-linear)
			- Repeating **liminoid** rituals, creating a **liminal** ritual
		- Needing to perform ritual repetitively in order to enact change slowly /
		Needing an archetype to follow, a destiny
			- **Restored behaviour**, set of pre-established actions
			- **Hero's journey**
		- A ritual carries authority and rules with it, but these are not fixed
		- Where does this authority come from? For Alan, it is internal, so he has the power to directly change it
		- But also, because it is internal, without external help, he is ultimately doomed to only repeat and never truly change
			- Unable to escape the framing of himself as victim/monster
		- Saga (Alice) teaches him the importance of writing your own story
			- Collaboration, different perspectives, alternative to monomyth
- why your topic and/or argument matters.
	- Understanding why this game connected with me
	- Blurring between art and ritual
		- **Efficacy**

## Writing!!! ðŸ˜±

I will utilize performance theory and narratology to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the processes of personal growth and art creation in the 2023 survival horror videogame *Alan Wake 2*, developed by Remedy Entertainment. Specifically, the comparison between ritual and personal growth brings *Alan Wake 2* focuses on the dual stories of its titular character, a tortured writer who has been trapped in a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place for over a decade, and Saga Anderson, an FBI detective pulled into Wake's horror story when she begins to investigate ritual murders seemingly related to Wake. Throughout the game, the characters engage in various ritualistic actions

During his captivity, Wake is stuck in perpetual loops of attempting to escape the Dark Place by writing stories, as the Dark Place embues art with reality-altering powers. These stories take the form of horror stories about ritualistic murders involving Wake's evil double, Scratch, who was created by the Dark Place to stop him. These attempts consistently fail however, as Wake believes that he must stick to what he perceives as the genre conventions of horror, namely that all the characters fall into the roles of monsters or victims. Through the lens of performance theory, these conventions he sticks to when writing can be seen as the rules of certain kinds of performances, namely rituals. By only writing within these rules, however, he ultimately writes himself in as alternatively a victim and a monster, forgetting each time the loop resets.

- Main arg: Comparing rituals to the process of personal growth illuminates how one can get stuck following unhealthy behavioural/cognitive patterns as well as the need to persevere despite repeated failure.

- vague: ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the processes of personal growth and art creation
- elements:
	- getting stuck in unhealthy patterns
	- non-linear processes
		- one will fail and make mistakes
		- repetition, starting over, is an inherent part of the process
	- Ultimately, a lot of the difficulty is internal, which means it is within our power to escape
		- still difficult
- Elements of rituals:
	- Rules, script 
		- Carry authority
			- Can propel one through a difficult process, despite being scary, one doesn't have a choice
			- Can also make someone feel less responsible
		- Are artificial, fabricated, not natural
			- Despite how it might feel, they can be changed
	- Focus on efficacy
		- Unlike other types of performance these processes could be compared to, rituals are most associated with some kind of purpose they are trying to achieve
		- In fact there is a whole set of rituals called liminal rituals that directly serve the purpose of helping the ritual's practitioner with a big life change
			- Connection to monomyth, the idea of character arcs
			- Ultimately the whole game's events is one of these rituals
		- This should come first, as it *validates* my focus on rituals as the type of performance 
			- Maybe I could talk about more general performance elements beforehand, before honing in on rituals as key to understanding Alan's and Saga's journey
	- Community
		- COuld perhaps be related to Alan learning to accept help from others? To hear others' perspective?
