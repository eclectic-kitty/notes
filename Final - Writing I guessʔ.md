# Final - Writing I guessʔ

## Outline
- topic
	- relationship of games to rituals
- clearly define key terms
	- ritual
	- gameplay loop
	- 
- identify a case study
	- Alan Wake 2
- state your main argument(s)
	- The game invokes the concept of rituals to illuminate the process of change
		- spiral as a nesting doll of rituals (ritualistically engaging in bad behaviour, recognising bad behaviour and source, working to change it, restarting, non-linear)
		- needing to reapeat in order to enact to enact change slowly (memetic set of actions)
		- A ritual carries authority with it, but it is an authority that can be changed over time
		- Where does this authority come from? For ALan, it is internal, so he has the power to directly change it
		- But also, because it is internal, without external help, he is ultimately doomed to only repeat and never truly change
		- Saga (Alice) teaches him the importance of writing your own story
- why your topic and/or argument matters.
