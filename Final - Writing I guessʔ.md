# Final - Writing I guessÊ”

## Writing!!! ðŸ˜±

I will utilize close reading techniques, informed by performance theory, to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth in the 2023 survival horror videogame *Alan Wake 2*, developed by Remedy Entertainment. *Alan Wake 2* focuses on the dual stories of its titular character, a tortured writer who has been trapped in a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place for over a decade, and Saga Anderson, an FBI detective pulled into Wake's horror story when she begins to investigate ritual murders seemingly related to Wake. Throughout the game, many of the characters' actions are compared to performances, especially rituals. This is especially true of Alan's attempts to escape the Dark Place via writing stories that form the basis for the events of the game, as art is granted reality-altering powers by the Dark Place. Indeed, the most important differentiation between rituals and other kinds of performance is that rituals seek to effect change, whereas other performances seek to entertain (Schechner 159). More specifically, there's a type of ritual called a liminal ritual. As "liminal"
refers to in-betweens, thresholds, liminal rituals seek to effect or ease a transformation in the performer. In fitting with the monomyth Alan's writing ritual and the game's events also ultimately serve to effect such a transformation in him, as he learns to overcome the less healthy aspects of his personality very literally represented in Mr. Scratch, a persona he is transformed into when possessed by the Dark Place. The books he write over the course of this and the first game are even named after the three stages of Joseph Campbell's monomyth. 

Another aspect of rituals that brings clarity to Alan's journey is that of rules. Rituals
