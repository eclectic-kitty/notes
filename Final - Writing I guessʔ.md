# Final - Writing I guessÊ”

## Writing!!! ðŸ˜±

I will utilize close reading techniques, informed by performance theory, to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the process of personal growth in the 2023 survival horror videogame *Alan Wake 2*, developed by Remedy Entertainment. *Alan Wake 2* focuses on the dual stories of its titular character, a tortured writer who has been trapped in a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place for over a decade, and Saga Anderson, an FBI detective pulled into Wake's horror story when she begins to investigate ritual murders seemingly related to Wake. 

Throughout the game, many of the characters' actions are compared to performances, especially rituals. This is especially true of Alan's attempts to escape the Dark Place via writing stories that form the basis for the events of the game, as art is granted reality-altering powers by the Dark Place. Indeed, the most important differentiation between rituals and other kinds of performance is that rituals seek to effect change, whereas other performances seek to entertain (Schechner *An Introduction*, 159). More specifically, there's a type of ritual called a liminal ritual. As "liminal" refers to in-betweens, thresholds, liminal rituals seek to effect or ease a transformation in the performer. In fitting with the monomyth Alan's writing ritual and the game's events also ultimately serve to effect such a transformation in him, as he learns to overcome the less healthy aspects of his personality very literally represented in Mr. Scratch, a persona he is transformed into when possessed by the Dark Place. The books he write over the course of this and the first game are even named after the three stages of Joseph Campbell's monomyth. 

Another aspect of rituals that brings clarity to Alan's journey is that of rules and the authority they carry. Rituals are an especially structured type of performances. They have a relatively strict set of rules or script with neither an internal, nor social source, but one beyond mere humans, something divine or otherwise revered (Schechner, *Theory* 16). Throughout the game, Alan makes various appeals to a similar set of rules: genre constraints. Specifically, he insists that in horror, every character is either a victim or a monster, and thus these are the roles he and everyone else must play, discarding the possibility of a happy ending for anyone. His defference to storytelling goes even further, directly giving it power and authority, declaring that "this story is a monster" and that it "will eat you alive". Returning to personal growth, this authority and adherence to its rules mirrors that of one's self image. Self-destructive behaviours have a nasty habit of reinforcing themselves. Comitting such actions can cause one to believe that they are fundamentally a bad person, which in turn makes it easy to continue comitting such actions. This statement of belief makes itself real, much like art in the Dark Place. Indeed, Alan initially believes that Scratch is an external entity, before learning it is a possessed version of himself. As he believes the story he is writing can only feature victims and monsters, he ultimately believes that he can only be a victim or a monster, preventing him from changing his behaviour and escaping the Dark Place.

However, the final aspect of rituals that I'll focus on is that they are constructions. Despite the air of permanence that can result from the authority rituals carry, they can be changed by practitioners or religious authorities in order to fit their needs (Schechner *Introduction* 160). Multiple characters in the game refer to the constraints Alan works under as self-imposed, as being ultimately his interpretation of how the game's universe works. Ultimately, Alan is able to escape preceisely by changing what he understands as the conventions of horror, or even storytelling itself. A frequent criticism of the monomyth is that it only allows for one character to the play the role of protagonist or hero, which leads to a more individualistic world view, similar to the great man theory of history Thanks to Saga, he is able to realize that horror stories can also allow for heroes, allowing him to play a new role in the story, change his behaviour, and ultimately escape.
