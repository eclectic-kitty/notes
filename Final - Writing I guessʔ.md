# Final - Writing I guessÊ”

## Writing!!! ðŸ˜±

I will utilize close reading techniques, informed by performance theory, to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the processes of personal growth and art creation in the 2023 survival horror videogame *Alan Wake 2*, developed by Remedy Entertainment. Specifically, the comparison between ritual and personal growth brings  *Alan Wake 2* focuses on the dual stories of its titular character, a tortured writer who has been trapped in a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place for over a decade, and Saga Anderson, an FBI detective pulled into Wake's horror story when she begins to investigate ritual murders seemingly related to Wake. Throughout the game, the characters engage in various ritualistic actions

During his captivity, Wake is stuck in perpetual loops of attempting to escape the Dark Place by writing stories, as the Dark Place embues art with reality-altering powers. These stories take the form of horror stories about ritualistic murders involving Wake's evil double, Scratch, who was created by the Dark Place to stop him. These attempts consistently fail however, as Wake believes that he must stick to what he perceives as the genre conventions of horror, namely that all the characters fall into the roles of monsters or victims. Through the lens of performance theory, these conventions he sticks to when writing can be seen as the rules of certain kinds of performances, namely rituals. By only writing within these rules, however, he ultimately writes himself in as alternatively a victim and a monster, forgetting each time the loop resets.
