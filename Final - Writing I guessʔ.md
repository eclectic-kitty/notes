# Final - Writing I guessÊ”

## Outline
- topic
	- Use of ritual imagery
- clearly define key terms
	- see bolded words
-  case study
	- Alan Wake 2
- state your main argument(s)
	- The game invokes the concept of rituals to illuminate the process of personal growth
		- spiral as a nesting doll of rituals (ritualistically engaging in bad behaviour, recognising bad behaviour and source, working to change it, restarting, non-linear)
			- Repeating **liminoid** rituals, creating a **liminal** ritual
		- Needing to perform ritual repetitively in order to enact change slowly /
		Needing an archetype to follow, a destiny
			- **Restored behaviour**, set of pre-established actions
			- **Hero's journey**
		- A ritual carries authority and rules with it, but these are not fixed
		- Where does this authority come from? For Alan, it is internal, so he has the power to directly change it
		- But also, because it is internal, without external help, he is ultimately doomed to only repeat and never truly change
			- Unable to escape the framing of himself as victim/monster
		- Saga (Alice) teaches him the importance of writing your own story
			- Collaboration, different perspectives, alternative to monomyth
- why your topic and/or argument matters.
	- Understanding why this game connected with me
	- Blurring between art and ritual
		- **Efficacy**

## Writing!!! ðŸ˜±

I will utilize performance theory and narratology to explore how ritual imagery is invoked in order to illuminate the processes of personal growth and art creation in the 2023 survival horror videogame *Alan Wake 2*, developed by Remedy Entertainment. *Alan Wake 2* focuses on the dual stories of its titular character, a tortured writer who has been trapped in a nightmare dimension called the Dark Place for over a decade, and Saga Anderson, an FBI detective pulled into Wake's horror story when she begins to investigate ritual murders seemingly related to Wake. 

During his captivity, Wake is stuck in perpetual loops of attemptsing to escape the Dark Place by writing stories, as the Dark Place embues art with reality-altering powers. These stories take the form of horror stories about ritualistic murders involving Wake's evil double, Sratch, which he believes was created by the Dark Place to stop him. These attempts consistently fail however, as Wake believes that he must stick to what he perceives as the genre conventions of horror, namely that all the characters fall into the roles of monsters or victims. Through the lens of performance theory, these conventions he sticks to when writing could be seen as the rules of certain kinds of performances, namely rituals. By only writing within these rules, however, he ultimately writes himself in as alternatively a victim and a monster, forgetting each time the loop resets.
