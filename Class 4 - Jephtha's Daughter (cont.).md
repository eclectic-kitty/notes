# Class 4 - Jephtha's Daughter (cont.)

### interpretations
"he did to her as he vowed"
What did he do?
A lot of interpretation as to whether or not he ended up killing her, some people try to soften her fate

"you opened your mouth"
Is she accepting her fate?
Is this a simple acknowledgement?
This could be interpreted as sarcastic
ultimately not sarcastic as written

### Cultural context
What is the role of a father, of a daughter?
Is it obedience?
We have to separate from our own culture
Looking at biblical context, are daughters obedient?

Not a lot of (active) daughters around in the bible
But the ones that are there are not necessarily obedient
example given: Miriam
Not a "toolkit" of women in the bible

There is more wifely submission, however

### child sacrifice
A lot of Jewish sources will say the bible opposes child sacrifice, they will try to use interpretation and translation to change what "he did to her as he vowed" is
But, what he vowed is a burnt offering

### Why is this story here?
Judges is somewhat strange,
A lot of political stories where the Israelites suffer horrible situations
The people get worse and worse over time

Jephthra is here as an ultimately negative example
One should not try to negotiate with, manipulate, God
One is meant to *ask* god for things, but not directly try to trade with Him

## Comparison with Abraham & Isaac

### Story

God commands Abraham to sacrifice Isaac
Emphasis on his only, beloved, etc. son
Abraham listens to him, takes Isaac up to a mountain
Use of Hebrew word "hineni"
Isaac asks what they'll sacrifice, Abraham tells him that God will provide
