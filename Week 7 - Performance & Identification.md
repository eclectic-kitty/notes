## Thesis statement

Thesis statements should be articulated as an argument
Look for your argument word
How can it be more precise (without being wrong)
Does **something missing here, check recording**
One can use own experience, but it must then be connnected to objective fact

### What?
A one to two sentence statement of your main argument

### Why?
Test of the strength of your ideas
Aid to organisation of those ideas, both for you and your reader!

### Elements
Topic and/or case study
Hypothesis and approach
Justification of purpose

## Performance Studies
Hasn't been utilised to analyse games as much
Same as games can be seen as systems, stories, could be perform
relativey new field, emerged in the 60's or so

### To perform
From French "parfournir", to carry out

### Four categories (according to Schechner)
- Being
	- first elements of identity and personhood, roles, gender expression, performing what we are, often unconscious etc.
- Doing
	- Action, animate and non-animate, cells, elephants, humans, machines
- Showing doing
	- what we typically think of performances, attention payed to doing something
- Explaining showing doing
	- study of all of the above, the field of performance studies

### Critiques
Miles long but inches deep?
But it helps us think acros a range of objects

### Performance continuum
play - games - sports - pop entert. - performing arts - daily life - ritual

Instead of two categories of play and ritual,
Can help us think of how these relate to each other

### Play and ritual
Common activities of human life across time, culture, etc.
from anthropology

play is unstructured free time, serves no purpose in day to day life
Ritual is highly structured, stylised **go back to the audio for full def.**

### Four qualities
- special ordering of time
	- time is marked in specific ways
		- ex. acts, quarters of a game
	- also goes into space
		- ex. court, lines, stages
- Special value assigned to objects
	- object that is meaningless otherwise becomes important, takes on special meaning
- Non productivity in terms of goods
	- More thoeretical due to capitalism
	- tangible goods
- Rules
	- laws or informal conventions

### Chart
appeal to other
appeals to, or, received, by another, not necessarily human, "real", 
completed
Does the event have a predetermined ending
Symbolic reality
invoked, not our own reality, fictional? spiritual?
Scripted
a continuum

audience
someone watching the playing, the person doing the playing

Videogames fall across play, games, sports, and theater
we can apply ideas from all these fields to videogame analysis

## Identity
identification is complicated! Lots of different definitions across fields!
Here, we're taking a broad and general approach

The sameness of a person or thing at all times or in all circumstances; condition of being a single individual; the fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else; individuality, personality

Nowadays identity is very tied to identity politics, how violence and oppression was applied to certain groups

Can erase or obscure the complexity of identity

Closely tied to subject formation (will see in two or three weeks)

High degree of dynamism, can shift throughout time, space, body,
Very complex, 


### Identification
The determination of identity; the action or process of determining what a thing is or who a person is; discovery and recognition

demographic information (identifieers) are not stable, are not necessarily that representative of identity
Researchers can forget this

Shaw looks at identification to deal with this

Shaw's def of identification:
we might define identification as a process by which we come to feel an affective connection with a character on the basis of seeing that character as separate and yet a part of us in some way

#### As/With
Identifying as referes to identifying as a member of a specific group
A statement on being, closer relationship
being

identifying with refers to identifying with an experience or facet of identity
Still recognizing part of self, but bigger gap
Could be considered less as a gap, and more as empathetic
often more specific and selective
experiences and emotions

Identifying with means that that which they are identifying with is separate from themselves

### Disidentification

Recognizes as commonality with oneself and another and, at the precise same time, recognizes a schism or disconnect with this person

Used to explain/explore how a player can identify with a character despite a strong difference in identity

### Avatars
separate(ish) from characters, more representative of one's self
videogames mix this a little, different amounts
