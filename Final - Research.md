## Fisher - The Slow Cancellation of the Future

### The slow cancellation of the future


#### Quotes
this stasis has been buried, interred behind a superficial frenzy of ‘newness’, of perpetual movement.

the Hegel-Marxist mythology of Aufhebung and founding of the new totality of Communism; the bourgeois mythology of a linear development of welfare and democracy; the technocratic mythology of the all-encom-passing power of scientific knowledge; and so on.

Rather than the old recoiling from the ‘new’ in fear and incomprehension, those whose expectations were formed in an earlier era are more likely to be startled by the sheer persistence of recognisable forms. 

The feeling of belatedness, of living after the gold rush, is as omnipresent as it is disavowed.

the current moment is in the grip of a formal nostalgia,

On the contrary, those 30 years have been a time of massive, traumatic change.

cultural time has folded back on itself, and the impression of linear development has given way to a strange simultaneity.

The ‘futuristic’ in music has long since ceased to refer to any future that we expect to be different;

formal attachment to the techniques and formulas of the past,

officially set in the 1980s, feels as if it belongs to the 30s. 

There is no nostalgia for a historical period here (or if there is, it is only indirect): the longing of which Jameson writes is a yearning for a form. Star Wars is a particularly resonant example of postmodern anachronism, because of the way it used technology to obfuscate its archaic form.

nostalgia mode subordinated technology to the task of refurbishing the old.

### Why hauntology?

To haunt does not mean to be present, and it is necessary to introduce haunting into the very construction of a concept,’

Everything that exists is possible only on the basis of a whole series of absences, which precede and surround it,

any particular linguistic term gains its meaning not from its own positive qualities but from its difference from other terms.

the specter, then, is that it cannot be fully present: it has no being in itself but marks a relation to what is no longer or not yet’

psychoanalysis is also a ‘science of ghosts’, a study of how reverberant events in the psyche become revenants.

The first refers to that which is (in actuality is) no longer, but which remains effective as a virtuality (the traumatic ‘compulsion to repeat’, a fatal pattern). The second sense of hauntology refers to that which (in actuality) has not yet happened, but which is already effective in the virtual (an attractor, an anticipation shaping current behaviour

### Not giving up the ghost



#### Quotes
mourning is the slow, painful withdrawal of libido from the lost object, in melancholia, libido remains attached to what has disappeared.

They do no more than disavow the undeniable itself: a ghost never dies,

the culture which shaped most of my early expectations was essentially popular modernist, and the writing that has been collected in Ghosts Of My Life is about coming to terms with the disappearance of the conditions which allowed it to exist.

popular culture definitively established that it did not have to be populist.

distinguish the haunto-logical melancholia I’m talking about from two other kinds of melancholia.

a Left that is thus caught in a structure of melancholic attachment to a certain strain of its own dead past, whose spirit is ghostly, whose structure of desire is backward looking and punishing.

melancholia I’m talking about, by contrast, consists not in giving up on desire but in refusing to yield.

### Nostalgia compared to what?



#### Quotes
is hauntology, as many of its critics have maintained, simply a name for nostalgia?

nostalgia compared to what? 

PR and populism propagate the relativistic illusion that intensity and innovation are equally distributed throughout all cultural periods. 

those who can’t remember the past are condemned to have it resold to them forever.

the capitalist dystopia of 21st-century culture is not something that was simply imposed on us – it was built out of our captured desires.

we shouldn’t have to choose between, say, the internet and social security.

what haunts is the spectre of a world in which all the marvels of communicative technology could be combined with a sense of solidarity much stronger than anything social democracy could muster.

disarticulation of class from race, gender and sexuality has in fact been central to the success of the neoliberal project –

revolutionary take on race, gender and sexuality struggles goes far beyond the demand that different identities be recognised. Ultimately, it is about the dismantling of identity.

In the 21st century, by contrast – and the fusion of pop with reality TV is absolutely indicative of this – popular music culture has been reduced to being a mirror held up to late capitalist subjectivity.

To say that the culture was desolate is not to say that there weren’t traces of other possibilities. Ghosts Of My Life is an attempt to engage with some of these traces.

## Steyerl - Poor Images

### Intro - Poor Image?

Constantly deteriorated and reshaped
Passed along freely
"**transforms** quality into accesibility"
Abstract, idea in **becoming**
unique to digital tech, mocks its promises
**violent** dislocation

### 1. Low Resolutions

Focus is a **class position**
high res = high class, flagship
low res = derivatives
high res images, more rich
rich image establishes **hierarchies**
35 mm film, pristine, etc.
national culture, capitalist studio production, cult of male genius, **original** version
new tech allows to creatively degrade

### 2. Resurrection

insistence on rich images obscures anything lower
sometimes less important (ex. personally not watching movies on ur phone)
larger systemic consequences
	- neoliberal influence on media production
		- **Culture = commodity**
		- monopolies in media spaces
	- obscuring non-commercial cinema
		- **Too expensive** to screen, show on TV
		- Lived only in **"darkness of the archive"**

*Does she mean that they weren't made or weren't shown? (probably both)
Would it be possible for poorer copies to circulate? (seemingly yes? but not very efficiently pre-internet?)*

Somewhat lived on in alternate archives
VHS copies
Much easier now on internet, AVI files, theatre recordings, etc.
**resurrected** as poor images

### 3. Privatization & Piracy

Poor images not assigned any value in class society of images
as illicit or degraded, exemption from criteria
post-socialist & postcolonial restructuring of nation states
cultures, traditions, histories reinvented
film archives affected 
(*what does she mean that they were left without their supporting framework of national culture?*)

Archives end up privatized, rented out
allowing pirate copies to be distributed
poor image reveals decline & degradation of experimental cinema
originally made possible as culture production was task of state
privatization of intellectual property, marketing, commodification,
enable piracy & appropriation

### 4 Imperfect Cinema

Juan Garcia Espinosa: imperfect cinema
overcome divisions of labor, merging art with life & science, popular but not consumerist, etc.
inherently progressive, as opposed to reactionary perfect cinema
thought new tech & media would enable production from masses
**diminish distinction** b/ audience and author

Ultimately far messier
Lots of reactionary content
still commodified
represent the crowd in all its **contradictions**
countless people involved changing it bit by bit (*teehee*)

Redefined value of image?
not just resolution and exhange value (*???*), but also **velocity** intensity and **spread** (*virality?*)
compressed, travel quickly
semiotic production (*focus on symbols*)
**compressed**, flexible, **combine-able**, reintagrate-able

flattening of content, concept-in-becoming
General trend, tearing ideas out of context
'swirl of permanent capitalist deterritorialization
like conceptual art before it,
resistant to fetish value of visibility, high resolution
well suited for **tearing away context**, symbolization
compressed attention spance, impression rather than immersion, etc.

### 5 Comrade, what is your visual bond today?

easy spread -> new economy, circuit
marginalised content resurfaces more
builds **shared histories** and **networks** amongst people
not as reliant on corporations or states for framework
aura not based on permanence of original, but **transience** of copy 
(*yeah, don't really know what all this means*)
(*By being able to move around it's better at creating networks among its audiences and redistributors?*)

**visual bonds**
Dziga Vertov
communist visual language
inform, etnertain, organize viewers
more or less reality under information capitalism
audiences linked physically, excitement, anxiety

Peter Weiss, Aesthetics of Resistance, Third Cinema, Tricontinentalism
pamphlets, agit-prop films, underground zines, etc.
nonconformist media, **poor materials**
reactualizing historical ideas from these older forms

what is our visual bond today? link to the present

### 6 Now

A shifting of cirumstances
original **real thing** no longer important
