# IP Poster Thots

## Aesthetic
Collage seems like a natural fit here
I do wanna keep it relatively simple? Just to prevent creating extra work for me?
I could use text as a whitespace, maybe arrange it in fun patterns
I do like the punkiness associated with it
After all, the idea is very much ant-current state of things, anti-capitalist, etc.
I want some photocopy texture in there as well, a little grainy

I want something cutting in though, representing how current law stifles creativity
#### censoring
- censor bar?
- erased?
- DMCA/copyright notice
- Cut out
- Scribbled over

It would look nice to use that as 

### Colours
It could be black and white to stick with a more photocpy kinda look, that could be nice
If I do use colour, I think I would want it to be like, a section has been painted/dyed over with colour, not that I kept original colour
I think I'd also keep it to saturated loud colours
nothing too dark or pastel

## What it's about
I think I might want to focus on remix stuff, sampling, etc.
How the copyright system makes it near impossible to reuse 

I could also just talk about how the copyright system is intended to protect rightsholders, not artists, or to spur creativity

List of things wrong
- Fair use is very fuzzy
- It's prohibitively expensive for anyone other than big companies to defend their use
- Limits transformative use of other properties
- Copyright terms are absurdly long (death + 70 years, or 95 years)

- Any kind of artwork that involves using bits and pieces of older work (ex. remixes, collage, sampling) puts artists at legal risk. This shuts
