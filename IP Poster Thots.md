# IP Poster Thots

## Aesthetic
Collage seems like a natural fit here
I do wanna keep it relatively simple? Just to prevent creating extra work for me?
I could use text as a whitespace, maybe arrange it in fun patterns
I do like the punkiness associated with it
I want some photocopy texture in there as well, a little grainy

I want something cutting in though, representing how current law stifles creativity
#### censoring
- censor bar?
- erased?
- DMCA/copyright notice
- Cut out
- Scribbled over

It would look nice to use that as 

### Colours
It could be black and white to stick with a more photocpy kinda look, that could be nice
If I do use colour, I think I would want it to be like, a section has been painted/dyed over with colour, not that I kept original colour
I think I'd also keep it to saturated loud colours
nothing too dark or pastel

## What it's about
I think I might want to focus on remix stuff, sampling, etc.
How the copyright system makes it near impossible to reuse 

I could also just talk about how the copyright system is intended to protect rightsholders, not artists, or to spur creativity

List of things wrong
- Fair use is very fuzzy
- It's prohibitively expensive for anyone other than big companies to defend their use
- Limits transformative use of other properties
- Copyright terms are absurdly long (death + 70 years, or 95 years)

- Any kind of artwork that involves using bits and pieces of older work (ex. remixes, collage, sampling) puts artists at legal risk. This shuts

### Text

Copyright law protects them not you
Copyright law protects big companies, not artists

Copyright law stifles creativity
To protect rights holders, not artists
To protect them, not you

Knowledge and art should be freely accessible

Copying is necessary for creativity
Copying is essential for creativity
Copying *is* creativity

Intellectual property is theft
Intellectual property is the theft of creativity
remixing is creativity
Creativity is remixing

Copyright law stifles remixing
Remixing is creativity

### Visuals

I want some kind of scene of creation/creativity interrupted
Maybe a musician recording?
A DJ spinning records?
Either that or a more abstract collage, like an explosion of different creative stuff (ie RIP cover)
AN explosion off of a record?
