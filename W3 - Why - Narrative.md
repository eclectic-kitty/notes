# Why do we play games? - Stories & Narrative

Not present in sports/board games
Very present in digital games and RPGs

## Story vs. Narrative
Narratology distinction: The story is the series of events being told, whereas narrative is how the story is told
Facts vs. communication

Ex. Little Red Riding Hood
The events themselves form the story
Different narratives could be constructed from the story, different details, starting from the end, etc.

Ex. Bioshock
Story of Rapture - told through environmental storytelling + Sound recordings

## Old and new frameworks

**imaginative immersion** (SCI Model)
non-RPG games nevertheless have stories
Absorb the player
Using imagination to empathise with characters, fantasy, world, etc.

**mimicry** (Cailloix, four kinds of games)
role-playing, playing to believe
Being different from one's self
Kind of obvious when one considers kids playing doctor, house, kitchen
RPGs, videogames, sexual role*playing*

**4 Keys 2 Fun**
"easy", "hard", "people", "serious" fun, unclear/misleading
narrative play isn't necessarily easy, what Lazzaro means is that it's not challenge based
easy fun/immersion key, entices curiosity; ambiguity, inompleteness, detail -> living world
drawing attention, allowing audience to imagine detail
Instead of doing all the worldbuilding all at once, you leave mystery, feed info slowly, if at all, allow player to search for the info
Angry Birds: Why are these birds fighting these pigs? Who built these structures? Intriguing...
players who like easy fun like:
- exploring worlds
- excitement and adventure
- want to investigate, figure it out
- learn story, even if they use a walkthrough
- feeling as one with player avatar

## Uncertainty
Games can make players even more invested in uncertainty compared to (most) movies, novels, etc.
It is up to you to decide the arc, more or less

**Narrative Anticipation** - Costikyan
key in narrative, keeping player uncertain as to how story will evolve, how the play arc of the game will develop
**Play Arc**
The trajectory of a game, how it *plays* out.
Variation over time of player advantage or favorable outcomes - Jonathan's definition

Typical, prototypical arcs
Games have a tendency for play arcs to develop in familiar ways, depending on how fast difficulty rises, how quickly player is rewarded

## Why are stories immersive?
Noel Carroll asks, what makes suspense in film?
Narratives raise questions, keeping audiences on the hook for answers
Strong force: watching something you don't like to find out what happens

Lost
Shot: Opens with close-up of eye, opening suddenly
Seem panicked, what's going on, who are they?
shot: Trees from below
Connections: person is lying down, seeing trees
Hypothesis: are they lying down in a forest?
Shot: zoom out from above shot
Confirmation, this man is lying down in a forest
Why is he wearing a suit and lying down in forest? Looks confused? So he doesn't know what he's doing there either?
Sound cue: pov shot through the plants
What's there?
It's a dog? Looks friendly, not a threat
Shot: man finds tiny vodka bottle in pocket
Hypothesis: man got drunk? That's why he doesn't remember stuff? From a hotel???

## The **Erotetic** Model:
Micro questions: moment-by moment, contribute to 
Macro questions: More story-wide, main goals and questions
Similar to our gameplay loops, micro loops and macro loops
The **curiosity loop**
Hyptheses, refutal, so another one, or validation
Satisfaction + emotion (surprise, sorrow, laughter)
Reversal, Complication
Questions
and around again

## Why are we **immersed**?
We want to know what will happen...
- becomes outcomes are uncertain
- because multiple outcomes are possible
- because we care about these outcomes (stakes)
So we become psychologically engaged in considering and weighing possible futures

## Costs and rewards

The **costs** of narrative immersion
- Taking time to learn about characters, situation:
Starting a new series, needing to learn enough about a story to care and take the time to watch
Films need to recreate this work constantly, whereas series have that built-in past beginning
Ex. Fantastical stories (sci-fi, fantasy) often require more of this due to new world vs. realistic stuff
- Caring, emotional investment
- Invoking empathy
Empathy can be like a muscle, certain kinds of narratives can be easier to get into
- Mood selection:
Sad/grim things can be a cost to not want to be immersed or can be a cost to continue immersion
Discomforting content

The **rewards** of narrative immersion
- Discovering other lives, realities
- Living vicariously
Watching cool surfer/rockstar/etc.
- Intense emotions in safety, sans consequences
Like horror movies!
- Puzzling over/considering ideas

## 2 types of narratives in games
1. **Embedded** narratives
2. **Emergent** narratives

### Embedded
Predefined narrative stuff that can be encountered
- Textual or vocal narration
- Characters, environments (could be context but could also be story, no?)
- Scripted events
Generally work like traditional narratives

**Issues**
Can lead to ludonarrative dissonance,
Games tend to have player agency, but...
Embedded stories like **linearity**, which is in conflict with agency
Why continue the game if you know what the story is? or if you can't actually impact it?

**Player agency** def:
The satisfying power to take meaningful action and see the results of our decisions and choices
Lack of agency -> feeling trapped, going through the motions

Players, given agency, will they generate poor stories? Do we need to control them?
(Whenever I play horror games and end up in very little danger because of how carefully I play)

Games with embedded narrative ~= vinaigrette, emulsion of two theoretically incompatible things, water and oil, agency and story

Vinaigrette recipes
- Branching stories
Can be developmentally costly
- Unlocking narrative through challenges
Typical, most prevalent, gameplay interspersed with story chunk
- Environmental storytelling
Story is not being enacted, discovering story afterwards, third or second party to story
Told through cues in the environment/level
- Discovering backstories
