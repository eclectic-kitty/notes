performativity names how social reality can change over time

### Q1: Shibboleth, 2022, addresses lack of queer archives in historical archives, what alt. archive does the work imagine?

Work consists of images of torsos, look almost in relief???

Documentary photography doesn't focus lack of access to history. 
Targets those marginalised. 
Inspired by images on Tinder in Egypt. 
Focused on the body, how subject wants to portray their own body, sexuality, etc. 
Transformed those images, private archive, traditionally thought of as poor image. 

Headless, faceless, classical sculptures, compared to photographs

Showing process to see how easy it is to manipulate
the construction of an archive

### Q2

Trauma lives in the body, can affect the body. 
How does does inequity affect and limit the body. 
If we name oppressions we experience, they can become a little more manageable, confrontable. 
If we spotlight body and use it to amplify the reality, we can move the trauma, a catharsis. 
Theatre of the oppressed, originated in Brazil, creator moved to Argentina cuz of dictator, 

### Q3: Noodle from 'How to smile?', beacon to exhausted weirdos in the world, weird difficult body to move, etc. what has Noodle taught April?

Self portrait character. 
Feels like a cartoon living in this world
Noodle is a bit of a blank surface, a lot of space for others to project their experiences onto them, collective creation. 
Uselessness <- neoliberal capitalism, indoctrinates people with idea that self worth comes from productivity. 
That kind of idea has really hurt them. 
Encourage us to stop caring for each other, our bodies. 

Why try to be useful to a system that has hurt them so much? 
Tries to encourage people to slow down, it's ok to be tired. 
Political choice to slow down. 
Intention to be useless. 

In the performance, How to Smile?, Noodle walked around mapping a cartoon smiley face via GPS. 
Noodle took the body for a walk! 

### Q4: Caring for bodies by keeping them anonymous

Self-care commodified, slogan, marketable term. - April
Take care of yourself. 
You don't need to go to Lush to get a bath bomb to take care of yourself. 
Simplify things for yourself. Relish little everyday moments, simple pleasures. 

Every politic is also a politic of the body - Pedro
Wanting to be aware of how we are provided with technologies to change how our bodies operate. 
How politics enter our bodies both mentally, but also physically

Hydrofeminism - Molly
how drugs we take end up partly in the water supply, 
ingested by other people, esp. 

Plastic as an anonymous material? 
Unlike wood or stone, they can be traced back to physical locations. 
So synthetic, connections between it and the physical world have been broken. 

Queerness represented by chewing gum. 
Violence enacted on it, but it doesn't break. 

### Q Is the body a limit or an extension of your work?
Pedro: body is in constant process of production. 
He doesn't have the same relationship to it as a dancer or tattoo. 
Accesses body through images, which is different from the body itself. 
Body helps articulate the knowledge
Jessica: tears contain cortisol, physically giving one a reprieve from stress
