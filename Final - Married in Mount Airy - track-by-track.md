# Final - Married in Mount Airy - track-by-track

## Married in Mount Airy 

### Musical elements
Distorted noisy acoustic guitar, pitch bending
echoy vocals
Background vocal repeating a little after
Sibilants doubled a lot a lot alot
high pitched backup vocals
syrupy far away echoy electric guitar
low muted acoustic guitar very close
wordless backup vocals ramping up to target note (similar to distorted guitar)

### Lyrics
I was married in Mount Airy 
In its prime, sometime in the late 60’s 
Where he carried me into a lover’s suite 
And we made love beneath 
The mirrored ceilings 

And things were merry at Mount Airy 
Where they’d sing, 
“All you have to bring is your love of everything” 

Don’t recall what we were drinking but 
I remember thinking 
There was something very strange in the air 
Don’t recall what we were singing but 
I remember swinging 
With my hands caught in the curls of his long hair 

Don’t recall what we were drinking… 

But I could swear he tasted of Sherry 
Contrary to the maraschino cherries 
With our own colour TV 
Heavenly shag carpeting 
A world apart from the ordinary, 
Something in the air 

And things were merry at Mount Airy 
Where they’d sing, 
“All you have to bring is your love of everything!” 

Don’t recall what we were drinking but 
I remember thinking 
There was something very strange in the air 
Don’t recall what we were singing but 
I remember swinging 
With my hands caught in the curls of his long hair                          

## Gold Satin Dreamer

### Lyrics
Light bleeds in through the curtain lace 
Sleep on the couch where the flowers stay 
And never bloom, but only fade 
In the sun 

I fill the bath while I dream of the lake 
I can smell the blood purged from raw steak 
By the barbecue on a summer day 
In the sun 

But I find you here, in the blue light of the TV 
And I feel you in the wind 
Through the back screen at night 
With the kitchen tile cold on my cheek 
I love you, baby 

Gold satin dreamer 
Gold satin heart 
Gold satin dreamer 
Waiting for it to get dark 
I wait for it to get dark 

All of those dreams left out in the sun 
They run like syrup and clot like blood 
Disfigured beyond recognition 
In the sun 

Colours fade from my memories and even though 
Other faces I forget, yours is carved of stone 
Tryna take you out of me is like 
Tryna get smoke out of wood 

Gold satin dreamer 
Gold satin heart 
Gold satin dreamer 
Waiting for it to get dark 
I wait for it to get dark

## Dogwood

### Lyrics
O Lord, please don’t take him from me 
I need him, you know I do 
I try to stop him from using that shit 
But there’s no telling that man what to do 

But you’ll have to pry him from my cold, dead grip 
If you try taking him from me, O Lord 
And you know I refuse to understand that he just makes his own bed 
And there’s no use trying 

O Lord, please don’t give him those wings 
You know how reckless he can be sometimes 
And o I swear doesn’t mean it when he says 
He don’t care if he lives or dies 

And I’m not sure if you can hear this, but I read 
Your name across his chest and I thought I’d try 
So if you’re there, Lord, I am begging you to spare him 
Just spare him, to you I cry 

Or you’ll have to pry him from my cold, dead grip 
‘Cause I’m not letting go of him

## Runnin' Free

The days are long, please don’t go 
I can’t trust myself to be alone 
The sun beats down, 
My wrists burn on the stove 
In this lonely ’78 motorhome 
I stay here, alone inside 
With the Sunday dinner and the summertime flies 
Motorcycles rev outside 
From the backyard screen 
I hear them drive off into the night 
But I know 

If I told him I’d die here if I stay 
He would hold me in his arms and he’d 
Love it that way 

Sad teddy bears on the lawn outside 
Clean off the mud, hang them up out to dry 
Try to sleep, to pass the time by 
But the dogs in the yard 
Keep me up with their cries in the night 

But I know 
If I told him I’d die here if I stay 
He would hold me in his arms and he’d 
Love it that way 

The days are long, please don’t go 
I can’t trust myself to be alone 
It all goes dark, my bangs long overgrown 
In this lonely ’78 motorhome

## Bad Man

I wish he didn’t have to die
But he was a bad man

Wrote over the love story he left on my body
With somebody else’s hands
I’m still crying, but I’m not sorry
No, I couldn’t give a god damn about it now
I’ve washed him out of my clothes
I know he had to go
He had to go
And he’d say the same, you know

I wish he didn’t have to die 
But he was a bad man
What do I make of these tears that I’ve cried
Over that bad man?

I could tell you that I don’t love him
But you know it’d be a lie
Doesn’t mean I don’t condemn him
And god damn him, He knows why
I let it go, I’ve washed him out of my clothes
I know he had to go,
He had to go
And he’d say the same, you know

I wish he didn’t have to die 
But he was a bad man
What do I make of these tears that I’ve cried
Over that bad man?

## My Darling True

You won’t change your ways, my darling
And they say it’s time for me to let you go
‘Cause you may just be the death of me
But truth is, I’d love it so

If you’d hold me ’til I’m cold and blue
Hold me ’til I’m cold and blue

You play such wicked games, my darling
They must say, “that girl’s plain dumb,
Or she just loves pain”
Cause you may just be the death of me
But truth is, I’d love it so

If you’d hold me ’til I’m cold and blue
If you’d hold me ’til I’m cold and blue

## Moonlite

“Got you mounted on a wall
In the back of my mind” he said,
“I just can’t forget, try as I might
I’ve got this photo I’ve tried to burn but it don’t light
I stay on the drink and you stay on my mind”

“As you were when you were laying just like a two page spread
From a magazine in a negligee on the bed
By the window in moonlit flesh
So gaunt your skin looked blue and wet
You were my girl, my thing, my pet
To do anything I wanted with”
 
“I wanna hold you in my hands
Like a porcelain decanter
Take off the lid and fill you up with liquor
Smash you against the wall and let you fall
To pieces in my hands” He said

“I love you so much I can’t stand you and
I got you mounted on a wall in the back of my mind
And this piece of your soul caught in a 35mm slide
I see right through you like lace lingerie when I hold it to the light
And my girl, I pray you can feel my eyes
Going right through you”

And he drunker he got, the truer he spoke

He said, “I pray to God you know
I keep a piece of you locked in my heart
With memories I can bend into any shape I want
And I put you over the bed, or I break you in half instead
Sometimes you’re my girl and sometimes, bitch, you’re dead”

## Sometime After Midnight

He’ll be picking me up
Sometime after midnight
In the Buick Electra
Sometime after midnight

I know, I’ve spent all day 
Thinking of what I’ll wear
At the waterfall vanity
Showered and bare
Checking all the different sides of me
Split in three mirrors

But there’s this feeling in my stomach
Wondering if I should just ignore it but 
I was told when something bad happens
It’s usually at night
And I’m watching the sky turn black
By the window-side

## Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus

### Thots
Low syrupy (electric?) guitars, **watery**
Backwards cymbals before percussion fully kicks in?
Backwards percussion?
High wavery synth that slides from note to note
Very thick atmosphere overall
piano
Some high wordless vocals
Also vocals that repeat afterwards (**echo**)

### Lyrics
In the skeletal remains
Of a pool long since drained
Filled with rain,
Reclaimed by nature

Through the dark, I wade
As if in its Glory days
Knowing that I’ll make myself sick
From the water
Knowing all my tears and rage
Could load a revolver

I used to think, you must be the water I drink
Holding me down in these waters, down beneath
Singing to the sound of my screaming

But now I see

In the dark I wait
Right here where I once sunbathed
With all my dreams unfit for day
With all my tears and all my rage

I used to think you must be the water I drink
Holding me down in these waters, down beneath
Singing to the sound of my screaming
I used to dream of the day it’d be just you and me
Like the Wild West
Both of us shooting ’til one of us was dead

You cruel, cruel man

## Summit Song

## Whispering Glades

When you’re dead and buried with a smile painted on your face
Your eulogy like poetry, flowers overwhelming the wake
Where I’m sure as in your life there will be beautiful women there in your death
Crying out they swear they will love you until their very own last dying breath

‘Cause you just have this way of charming those 
Who catch your eye like shiny things
With a face made for daytime TV shows
You’re a nightmare disguised as a good dream

When she wants a garden, you give her a rose
Just the taste of something you could give her but you won’t
When she wants a garden, you give her a rose
And you know it

But you just have your ways, what with all of those 
Grotesque displays of love you show
Ripped from pages of books, every word which you know
And recite back to them as if they were your own

I feel sorry for them, because how could they know?
’Til they’ve died by your hands, ’til they’ve felt the cold
Cut of your sharp tongue with your delusions of grandeur 
yea you give nothing and think it too much

And when she wants a garden, you give her a rose
And I’ll bet you have to hide your grin as you watch it die in her arms
When she wants a garden, you give her a rose

When you’ve dearly departed 
There will be all those broken hearted
But I’ll have a smile painted on my face
There’s a spot in the grass waiting for you at Whispering Glades
And Hollywood suits you, darling, I think you should stay

## I'll Wait For You To Call

I’ll wait for you to call
And if I wait my whole life,
It won’t be wasted at all

I’m fine to love you from afar
And if I don’t see you again
I understand, it’s just how things are

I’ll wait for you to call
And if I wait my whole life,
It won’t be wasted at all
