# Workshop 1 Feedback - Melody
### Aurora Becerra Granados

1. **What were your first impressions as a reader?** You might consider the following to help guide your impressions: What stood out to you? What was compelling, surprising, memorable, difficult, unique, and/or confusing?
	- I was immediately struck by the use of the word "mommy" as an opening and the way it instantly put me into a child's perspective. It's extremely disarming. Throughout the piece, it's use continuously pulls me back into this state and it never quite becomes easy to hear.
	- There's also a strong contrast between the tragic more adult thoughts and the moments that feel a lot more childlike and nostalgic, which I found compelling
2. **What is the story “about”?** Is there a central theme or subject? How about a narrative arc?
	- The story seems to centre on themes of nostalgia, death, transformation, growing up, and emotional resilience.
	- There seems to pointedly be an almost non-arc, with the narrator remaining somewhat unable to accept their mother's illness, but perhaps trying to learn from it.
3. **How does the piece convey its intent?** This is different from the piece’s content; the intention refers to what the writing is trying to achieve, its underlying purpose, or its “why”. What aspects of creative nonfiction, such as personal anecdotes, memory, mood, thematic exploration, and description, are used to convey the piece? How does the author develop these aspects and what effect do they have on the overall narrative?
	- The intent seems to be to explore how difficult accepting change and transformation can be, as well as how nostalgia interacts with this desire, both hindering it by allowing you to avoid dealing with it, but also acting as a safe space by giving you respite from the difficulty of this process.
	- It does this partly through the direct retelling of personal anecdotes, and contrasting comforting memories with blunter writing about the narrator's mom's condition.
4. **What aspects of the piece are working well?** Consider elements like narrative structure, pacing, point of view, style, and audience. What aspects could be strengthened, and how might these improvements be made?
	- As mentioned before, I think the use of the word mommy does a great job in instilling both discomfort due to its suddenness, while also putting one in the headspace of a child. That being said, I did notice the use of other variations that maybe carried less impact, and I think they diminish the piece's impact.
	- Connected to this, I like the contrast in the piece between the present and the memories, especially the first paragraph with the descriptions of the painting.
5. **Develop one or two questions to ask your peers** such as, what inspired you to write this piece? What challenges did you face during the writing process? Can you elaborate on a particular passage, approach or theme you included? Are there earlier drafts of this piece, and if so, how did it evolve? What are your goals for future iterations of the piece?
	- How directly is the writing taking from real events? How did you decide what to include and what was maybe too personal? Were there drafts with less or more details?
	- How much were you consciously trying to keep the writing grounded?
