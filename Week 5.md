# Week 5

"Form ever follows function"

Function  dictates form

What we assume as natural is often  tradition instead

## UI Metaphor

Traced back to Xerox Alto
Inspired by Mother of All Demos ('68)

Ludic challenge
You are playing because at any point you can stop
A difficult UI or controls can be fun to learn to use, figure out
IF you have to do that for something you *have* to use, it can be frustrating instead

Xerox Star, what was brought to market, flopped, they didn't know how to market it
Xerox Star team members went to Apple, Apple saw the Star, made the Lisa
The Lisa wasn't as succesful though as the Macintosh

Metaphor:
skeuomorphism!
Any writing is a document,
Deleting files is using a trashcan
Storying files is in a folder

Metaphors have entailments

Juliet is the sun
- is warm
- is radiant
- gives life
- but what if...
- is so dense?
- is on fire?
- is gassy?

Not all are equal
- Ejecting by putting drive in trash

These metaphors simply aren't universal

Websites as hierarchical trees
Home, leads to different sections, and so on

Experiment in Cape Town, ppl who never used computers
Getting people to draw family trees
matriarchal and patriarchal separated, order different, etc.

When designing metaphors,
What does it look like?
What does it feel like?
How does it act?

Skeuomorphism
Used to ease people into new interfaces

neuomorphism to separate to be useful

requesting vs demanding\
asking people to subscribe vs demanding they turn off an ad blocker
