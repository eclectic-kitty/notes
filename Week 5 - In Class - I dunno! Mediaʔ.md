# Week 5 - In Class - I dunno! Media?

## Presentations

### Carboard Computers
How to mkae a new technological project

Utopia project
computer-supported newspaper production

storyboarding
idea

cardboard mockup
helping users envision what it would look like

integrating tech
used projector to further illustrate concept


mockup critical to any design

Testing with relevant users
typographers and journalists
important to focus on language game(?)
important for interaction to reflect reality

modify mockup based on feedback

make product

oki

### Mythinformation

Historical revolutions
had a plan
who gains power?
what social system is implemented?
Is it sustainable?

Computer revolution
vague
idealistic

Rebutting computer revolution hopes

New futuristic tech savvy jobs
menial non-automatable jobs will go to humans

people will gain equal power
corporations will leverage tech for their benefit

Large political change
Tech won't inherently change things
determinism

Computer revolutions equal distribution of power
1. People don't lack info, they don't know how to use it
2. More info != more knowledge, media analysis vs media consumption
3. knowledge does not equal power, you need also skill
4. democracy isn't achieved merely though access to information, built on self-governance

Warnings
More personal info online = more tracking
more computers = less face to face interaction
borders become less helpful which throws off society (???)

## Cybernetics

People

**1st wave**
Gordon Pask, Claude Shannon, Norbert Weiner
V men, v technical
flow of information in a system

**2nd wave**
Maturana & Varela, Heinz von Foerster
large scale systems, include observer
added James Lovelock
tasked with finding life on Mars
living systems
added Lynn Margulis
We're full of other organisms!
mitochondria: virus
interactions between observer and system

**3d wave**
virtual
construction of body as medium

**4th wave**
mixed reality or technogenesis

autopioetic theory
cognition that is self-emerging

recursive processes
omnipresent throughout thought processes,
social processses

Chomsky manufacturing consent

**boundaries**
biological organisms and machines
observer and system
observer system and env.

Fredkin, **meaning of info**
given by processes that interpret it
situated embodied consciousness
that is the enactive origin point

**media def.**
through specification
specs, parts, components, and features

**3 contributions**
feedback, framework, artifacts

Bruno Latour
moving from
matters of fact to matters of concern

Katherine Hayle's op.
Doesn't think we're all that close to uploading our minds
We're very nuanced
smells, emotions, 

structure
recursion
what she'll tlak about
details
brings back
brings back with diff. context
brings back with new context

By going forward and backward, wave after wave,
ignorance eroded, knowledge imparted

## Applied Theory
the internet
using data scraping to explore meme usage across meme publics
using data scraping to explore memes and feelings
using data scraping to explore qualitative theories of context

ex. project
downloading a bunch of surreal memes
what makes them a single meme?
downloading them
training a local instance of stable diffusion with them

generated bedrooms 
w/ stable diffusion, pretty normal
first gen of stable diffusion
faces on walls, weirder art on walls
very colourful
next malls
started noticing perspective often lower angle
computer generated imagery comes up a lot
cheap carpet
purples & bright colours

taking an idea and finding ways to figure out how to analyse or implement it in the real life
Reminded me of 

## Back to theory

suggested extra readings:
Xenogenesis series Octavia E. Butler
Temple Grandin The Autistic Brain - The world needs all kinds of brains and they can work together and complement each other
Neurodiversity in Relation - Estee Kier & Adam Wolfond

The Radical AI Podcast - What we previously thought of as good thought, we associate with work. In the past that skill mattered. Proximity to information is going to shrink. What amtters in that world? THe educational system spectacularly fails at getting students to ask good questions. Intellectual curiosity should be the fundamental thing. You have to create a love around mental work

How do I convert what really matters to me into a theory

## Media and our relationships

### Us! Instagram

we tend to use it a lot more for texting, and not it's main thing of pictures

Has lost its early simplicity and focus on photos
algorithmic pushes for videos, reels to compete with Tik Tok, stories as well

Function of scrolling, large size of feed
hard to see what's coming up
Functions like gambling, constant mystery

materiality
exists within our phones, omnipresent if we have our phones + the app

technology
algorithmic curation
lack of human intervention

semiotics
dissonance between purported intention: connection, cadid personal vibe
emergent vibe: advertising, self, brands, celebrities

social
recursion loop
algorithmic creation of small communities
it shows you more things of what you initially see, skews perception of site

### Instagram 2 electric boogaloo

semiotics
likes & followers: status symbol
filters: distorting perception
*how much are Insta filters still important*
clout chasing
trends: symbols, function in digital culture
Content: hashtags (*are these important on Insta at all? edit: maybe for algorithmic sorting*)

technogenesis
influence of ads: shapes our own content, feedback loop
adapts personal taste, which in turn adapts algorithm
filter bubbles: radicalising user
mediator, or lack thereof, of information

### Cinema

foreshadowing: Breaking Bad example, pants flying in the wind, plane crash. extension or effect on real life, seeing symbols
interactions: makers, viewer seeing fruit of interactions
social context: influences perception, social norms, stereotypes

consumption method: from going to theatre, or storing on physical medium, to digital
tech has degraded quality, but kept it alive
*really?*
Anyone can use it, remix it, keep it, create it
less rare, less skill required

### bindeo games

technogenesis
examples: wanting to become game designers
Detroit Become Human, changed social ideas about AI
Sims, becoming more creative

playing games to learn about field
to create stories
to destress

materiality
can be physical via disks, cartridges
can be dowloadable

Diff. b/ Sims 3 & 4
Sims 3 was better
more complete, absurd elements
*interested in more in-depth Sims discussion

### Tinder & digital romance

Feedback loop
Tinder takes personal data given by users + interests as people use it

UI: swipe, simple, focus
rewards: matching, super likes
push notifications: calling one back to the app, trying to place hottest people near the top if you haven't come back in a bit
personality: trying to personalize app a bit, tips, fake Word document on desktop

### Google Docs

social context: getting used to a certain interface

semiotics: use of icons to communicate functions, hamburger menu

technogenesis: commenting and editing documents with other people

How to enhance GDocs: voice recognition, unlimited cloud storage, offline mode, zen mode

what resources are allocated where? what does that say about the society that created it

### Video games 2 electric boogaloo

VR
immersive, versatile, tactile way to interact with and shape data
race to first mass-market VR product: Meta pricing their headset at a loss

materiality: controllers
input: buttons, gyro, microphones, touchpads, joysticks, analogue triggers, modularity, etc.

social effects: living in virtual worlds

What happens when big games shut down?
Do they disappear?
Can others pick up the slack?

semiotics
How easy is it to understand behind the scenes
engines and languages
Games for making games: ex. Dreams, Mario Maker, Roblox

modding
Some games seem to have more superficial modding scenes, whereas others are more about big changes to mechanics

social effects
lootboxes, deep patterns, virtual economies
