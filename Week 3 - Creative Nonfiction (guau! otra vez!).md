# Week 3 - Creative Nonfiction (guau! otra vez!)

Effy liked that I focused on how tough writing can be when we were discussing our daily notebook entries (and my failure* to do so)

## Elements of creative nonfiction (and probably most writing) to consider

- Inspired directly from real events
	- Either personally lived
	- Through others we know
	- Or historical
- Main purpose is, as in other creative writing, to communicate an emotion
	- ie, not academic writing to educate, communicate an idea
	- Could be in tandem with academic writing 
- Form is very open

Setting
- place
	- real?
- time
	- present, past, desire

Intent
- How we take content, form, etc. in harmony
- What are they achieving?

Form examples
- short
- long
- prose
- poetry
- shape and use of page

POV & Narration
- Perspective it's told from
	- 1st, 2nd, 3d, omniscient
	- multiple
	- unreliability
- voice
	- register
	- tone
- dialogue
	- Is it recreated directyl?
	- Or referred to?

Characters
- Who appears throughout?
- What is their relation to the real life people?

Audience & Address
- Who is it for?
- Specific?

Exposition & scene
- The former is explaining background
- The latter is description of the moment

Imagery & Theme
- What recurs?

## Reading - A History of My Body
Messy
fragmented
desne
"I", peronal
warnking
well-crafted
intention
poetic, metaphorical

Reflecting a fragmented background
Creates its own **taxonomy**
(Like feeld)

"crookedly and on the run"
"write my way out of a map and onto the land"

How to represent, how to do justice to something

Written to his grandmother
Calls to mind the past
His past
His grandmother's past
Ancestry
Home

Anecdotes ("I'll go crazy if I don't hear from you")
Distance, love
Recurring ideas that are very important to the text

slanted paragraph breaks
Some bits also have blank paragraph breaks!
One (of many) built-in pauses

Title
Sensory, bodily experiences
Connection to history, land

Loneliness personified

Use of "you" directly implicates the reader

paradoxical
born into a past to which he is also unintelligible
dead future in the territory of my people
queer life, an unattained utopia
collision of two forces, neither able to exist under colonialism, capitalism

### Writing about it
It's quite apt that my life (under capitalism, colonialism, etc.) is such a mess that I didn't have the time to engage with this piece as fully as I would've liked to. That I had to read it in a rush on the metro, the bus on my way to do my best to fit into this system we have to exist in. That immediately after I'm going on a date, the third person in the past three months or so. There is so much here that I connect with. The deep-seeded sensation of being out of place everywhere and everywhere. Of feeling like it's too late but also too early. Needing to struggle so. hard. to find the words, to describe. Of needing to associate disparate words in this language that has *nothing* to do with where I come from, but that is ultimately the one I feel most comfortable in. A language that has been used to control queer and non-white people.
