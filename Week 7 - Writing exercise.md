### doubling down, person, place, image, memories or situations
- how will sex occur in cyber-space? will we still want it or need it? what perverted uses can there be for machines?

## Choosing a topic
How will we interface with ghosts when we have become cyborgs

# What do I already know?
We currently live in a world full of nostalgia, referential media
Certain ghosts above others are focused on, but at the same time often removed from context in pursuit of capital
Information is treated as anything but epistemological, it's treated purely as bits without consequence
Things are removed form each other
and so, they come back to haunt us
The American Dream lives on despite decades of proof that it's just like Mount Airy
we continue to think of the internet as eternal to a certain extent, when it is anything but
the death of geocities

# what makes this topic interesting to me? What's important about it? What's the heart of it
will we understand the presence of our dead? or will we allow them to be forgotten and control us from the dark, to be afraid of them? Stuck in limbo (skinamarink), endlessly repeating the same cycles (married in mount airy) until we are turned to ash (instead of mulch).

What will we worship, what will permeate the culture?

# keep writing

I feel like I'm getting away from the digital, the computational
What is different about ghosts in the cyber cyborg hyper world?

Our current state of being online is focused on profit, on efficiency, on attention, on ad-revenue. IT interfaces with the past only insofar as it can be extracted from and thrown aside, left a husk. Connections are made despite of this system, and they aren't quite enough to sustain the natural (**huh, interesting word**) life of something. But nothing ever fully dies, connections **are** made, and it all haunts us in some way or another. We are not individuals, we can't be separated into ad categories.

In memes we can see how ideas to permeate and haunt us, how we return to the same thing, the same poor images, past generations of change. But we make it so hard to trace this lineage, to keep record, to sustain healthy connections

# what makes this hard for me?
It feels too broad, which is an eternal problem for me, certainly. Maybe I'm also trying to see it too much as something is wrong and needs to change? maybe I need to change my viewpoint to be less authoritative, as we are often trained to write. I haven't yet acknowledged the resilience, however small, of revolutionary elements online. The free software movement still exists and has infiltrated everything. I'm also struggling to connect it to any of the theory we've seen in class ... what have we seen in class? 

# keep writing - where is this leading?

maybe we need to learn to be urban explorers of the digital. we need to delve into the abandoned churches and mines and hospitals and schools of cyberspace, we need to reconolize them, not in an empirical sense, but in a bacterial sense. We need to make homes and spaces for us to exist in them instead of letting them be turned into expensive condos or empty but funded churches

# is this complete? What's missing

I think I need to talk to people and get their read on their situation
I need to find more theorists who talk about ghosts in this metaphorical sense, maybe hauntology? but I'm not sure
I want to connect it to the body as well, to interfaces, I/O

# does this suggest a shape or point of view
a poem? an essay? an argument? a personal narrative?
who's talking? who's point of view is this?

This is developing in an essay-ish format. I kind of really like Donna Haraway's referential style but I think I want to simplify it somewhat? I love the referential but simple nature of folk tales and religious texts. Make it less dense, allow for more space. It fits the idea of ghosts too, they love big empty mansions to fill up

# what journey did I take and where am I headed?

I felt a little round and round, 
I want to take a more concrete route, but in the backrooms, the liminal, I want to look at more technology too
