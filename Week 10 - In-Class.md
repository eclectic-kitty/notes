# Week 10 - In-Class

How do we situate ourselves in the topology of theory?

Animal Liberation - Peter Singer book
ethics in relation to projected other
aspect of field we all inhabit

heading into having to consider personhood of technological entities

## Ideology

Kimberle Crenshaw - Urgency of Intersectionality
Cruel deaths of black women
Stating circumstances, a problem
necessity of "saying her name"
listing names, evoking grief, 
Didn't fully get the placement of this video

Stuart Hall - Race the Floating Signifier
hanging trees, plantations, signifiers
Lost here

Judith Butler video
performed vs performative
performed is about something that has an effect
gender being performative means gender isn't there from the start

Disruptions
implies there is a solidified thing to break up

Donna Haraway
disrupting the *self*

Shoshana Zuboff
surveillance capitalism
capitalism takes external things into market dynamic
industrial capitalism: land, nature
surveillance capitalism: self, personal data
predictions on what we will do

Rosi Braidotti - Posthuman Knowledge
monetisation of an ideological fromation born concurrent with information age
culminates in proliferation of platforms engineered 
drive to perfect, optimising human machine, eugenics
perfection: not diverse?

3 provocations
- racism is productive
	- produces things of value to some
	- not an accident, a bug, etc.
	- innovative, systemic, etc.
	- racism is socially constructed & racism constructs
- race & technology are coproduced
	- inputs makes some things appear inevitable
- imagination is a battlefield
	- a resource
	- not something we should romanticize
	- many forced to live within others' imaginations
	- elite fantasies about profit, efficiency, social control
Citizen: waze for crime
- duplicity of tech fixes
Racist robots
- artifacts have problems, biases
- attempts to override default settings
- how do we differentiate tech used to differentiate
The new Jim Code
- innovation that enables containment
- coded bias + imagined objectivity
- hides racial domination, allows it to penetrate
- ex:
	- bias in medical algorithm favors white patients
	- race not an explicit factor in algorithm
	- uses cost for triaging
- accidental effects can be more harmful than malicious intent
- **Race critical code studies**

_Citizen, an american lyric_
C'est quoi?
poetry?

Paul B Preciado
Growing up under oppression of Franco regime
Need to be optimistic, that things can be changed
otherwise what is there to do?
Going from fascism to neoliberalism
Not knowing what freedom is
*Does anyone, though?*

Timnit Gebru
slow AI
On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?
Datasets 
homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution
dirty data?
embodiment no longer necessary, language is enough

## Jason Edward

How do you work with indigenous communities where one works with stories from those communities? How do you do that in a way that is primarily beneficial to the community
Preventing others form just taking and grabbing from there

AI Industry + Academics
rapacious
All this data! Nom nom nom, ours to consume

Alberta, Hawaii, New Zealand - areas where they're working - pods
Developing different methodologies per community
How to share knowledge across pods? Across network?

Jason doesn't believe opting out is an option
Even if you don't participate in the creation of this technology,
the technology *will* be used on you

agency, other beings
expanded view, time, space, radiation

agency and animacy?
natural evolution of language, gender of nouns
descriptive and prescriptive

not necessarily distinction between community and academia

natural language processors lose layers and nuance of meaning, polysemic languages

Ddecentering of ourselves

I think therefore I am, I can poke this thing so it exists
But like, that presupposes we are who exist
Collaboration instead of competition?

rationality?
wars aren't started rationally
There will always be something lacking if you just always approach things rationally

relationality
