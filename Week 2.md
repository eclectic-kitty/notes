# Week 2

## Levine reading

### Forms
**Def**: Transhistorical patterns shapes and arrangements that can organize social and literary objects

Can be found across history
not context-specific
Apply to social phenomena too

Ex. Letters
- Recognizable pattern
- Found across history and cultures

Ex. date:
	- 2 or more people
	- equals
	- set time and place
	- can be professional, friendly, romantic, etc.

#### Features
- Constrain
	- limit certain actions or outcomes
	- ex. sonnet limits free verse, class limits speech
- Differ
	- forms are distinct, can be discerned from each other, but...
- Overlap and intersect
	- Interact with each other, can be present at the same time while being distinct
- Travel
	- same forms can traverse time and space
- Forms do political work in particular historical contexts
	- Even if the form doesn't change, context around it can change and bring it to mean different things

**Genre**: Bring together customary collections of elements into historically recognized groupings of phenomena


## Game and narrative, def.
**Game**: Broadly, a type of human play, often involving rules or parameters, and sometimes involving competition
**Narrative**: Broadly, storytelling. An Account of events, often involving characters, settings, and action

videogames start as a subgenre, not a form
metagenre?
form?

Form of game, machine, story

## Affordance
A term used to describe potential uses or actions latent in materials and designs

> Glass affords transparency and brittleness. 
Steel affords strength, smoothness, hardness, and durability. 
Cotton affords fluffiness, but also breathable cloth when it is spun into yarn and thread.
Specific designs, which organize these materials, then lay claim to their own range of affordances. 
A fork affords stabbing and scooping. 
A doorknob affords not only hardness and durability, but also turning, pushing, and pulling. 
Designed things may also have unexpected affordances generated by imaginative users: we may hang signs or clothes on a doorknob, for example, or use a fork to pry open a lid, and so expand the intended affordances of an object.

Levine extends concept of affordance to forms

## Aarseth reading
Ergodic literature is literature where
> Nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text
Ergodicness is located in the text itself, prompted by the text itself

A complicated story isn't ergodic in and of itself, neither is difficult language, etc.

**translation** vs **choices**

Involves a level of decision-making
What order do you read the text in? Do you have to 

**Cybertext**
Organised mechanically
User has an effect on the meaning-making sequence of reading
not inherently ergodic
Distinct from printed books as it is machinic

Having to click on the links in *A Story as You Like It* makes it cybertext

Ergodic literature is a **form**, not a **genre**
has patterns and features that are not historically specific
links interactive fiction, hypertext, etc. to older examples of ergodic literature

**Aarseth argues**
Makes readers more active participants
marginalised genres in literary studies

## Group discussions
1. Affordances of ergodic literature?
	- agency
	- unique experiences, individuality
	- replayability
	- exclusion, *requires* effort
	- highten stakes 
2. What are its potentialities and constraints? How do these differ from non-ergodic literature? How do they differ between genres?
	- Prevents experiencing whole of text
		- More work for authors
		- Can lead to less depth
	- Clunkier in typical book format
	- Referencing specific parts
	- having the same experience
	- How does it differ from non-ergodic?
		- Tends to sprawl, feels wider
		- More agency and control
		- More immersive and not
			- You are making choices so you are in the story
			- But can also make you more aware of yourself
		- Unique paths
		- Less accessible, could be discouraging
		- passivity vs activity
		- Dynamic
		- More ambiguity
			- Meaning
			- Timelines
	- Genres
		- Choose your own adventure books feel less impactful
		- CYA books tend to be written in the second person, more emphasis on reader as main character
		- CYA books hold on to narrative structure more, decisions the character makes
		- Hypertexts have effectively limitless space, more choices, thus can lead to weirder structures
		- Hypertexts also allow for more editing after the fact
		- Games can afford accidents, points where you might get stuck, makes things less known
3. Do these differences truly matter for the reader/user or are they philosophical questions?
	- Fundamentally changes the experience different people have
	- Impacts meaning, themes
		- choice itself and the ideas that brings up
	- redistributes labour
4. Print vs machinic ergodic literature
	- Cybertext more restrictive to reader, book is ultimately in your hands
	- A book can be taken apart, reorganized, destroyed, etc.
	- Machinic can hold more
	- Book allows reader to estimate
	- nonprint can be updated
	- Cybertext affords more speed
	- Cost of production is very different
	- Books can't interact with other works directly, they can direct, but not directly, programs on your computer can watch you, read other things on your computer, etc.
