## Hexcells by Matthew Brown

The pandemic was very hard for me academically. I already had issues with focus and motivation, but online school during the pandemic just made these 10 times worse. I ended up with a lot of anxiety over finishing assignments and it was very hard to stay on-task whenever I had work to do. One of the few things that ended up helping was a little puzzle game called Hexcells.

The game is similar to minesweeper but with hexagonal cells. There are cells you have to break open with a click and ones you're meant to mark. The puzzle is figuring out which ones to break open with the help of numbers on broken cells that tell you how many around are meant to be marked.

One of the ways in which it helped me was with anxiety. It's designed with a lot of attention to detail and care towards providing a calming experience. Interacting with it is accompanied with little animations and sounds that make it feel rather tactile, such as seeing the cover of cells that you break explode into little pieces and fall away, or the way the cells bounce and you hear a low tap whenever they're moused over. It reminds me a lot of the stim toys that have become very popular. For its soundtrack, it features a droney set of harmonizing synths in the background. Melody and rhythm is added as semi-random tones play with every cell you break or mark.

The game thus provided a calming activity I could use as a break from work. I'd already heard that one way to help with focus issues was to take frequent small breaks and Hexcells' levels provided a bite-sized activity to do during those breaks. It was engaging, keeping my brain active, but it wasn't so engrossing that I would end up continuing to play the game instead of returning to my work.

## The Best Ever Death Metal Band Out of Denton by The Mountain Goats

This is a song I wanted to share because it speaks to a deep insecurity I have, and one that I'm sure many of my classmates, as fellow artists, share. What if I don't "make it"? I love art and I want to, need to make art so badly because I want nothing more than to connect with others around me. I want to share myself and allow others to see me and in seeing me see themselves. But for this, my work needs to be seen in the first place. What happens when I pour my life into learning to make art only for it to be drowned under the vast seas of art that pours out of so many of us? What if the right Audience never finds my work?

This song addresses this fear head-on, telling the story of the titular band: two boys named Cyrus and Jeff who never played a single gig, never recorded music, in fact never got past practicing in their bedrooms. Their dreams of "stage lights and Lear jets" are cut short when Cyrus' parents send him to a boarding school after finding pentagrams stenciled on his instrument. Cyrus and Jeff never even name their band.

However, the song's tone is far from one of defeat. Consisting only of an acoustic guitar and vocals, the song is ferocious as the lead singer tears into the guitar strings. Instead, he proclaims that the band will "both outpace and outlive you." before throwing in some 'hail satan's for good measure. The scale of Jeff and Cyrus' art is reframed. They were maybe never the best ever death metal band, but they were the best ever death metal band out of Denton. 

Ultimately the song says that it doesn't matter how many people see your work, how successful you are. AS long as it matters to you, it has value. I don't know if I'll be able to make a living from art, but I'll never stop making it.
