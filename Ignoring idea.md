# Ignoring idea

## Initial ideas

I had an idea about a horror story where there's **something** in the protagonist's room, in the corner, in the darkness, but the protagonist refuses to acknowledge it. He wants to avoid making it real, he wants to dream it doesn't exist.

While my mom was shouting at me and I realised I mostly just had to wait, I focused on a point in the room that specifically wasn't my mom. I focused on the specific shape of the underside of my chair against my blu esweater and its lines. I could feel my body shut down and ignore everything else just so I could survive and get past the fight.

## Thots

There's a paradox here about shutting down as a response to avoid harm, freezing, refusing to accept that which I know I can't do much to change or stop or avoid, contrasted with ignoring that which is fully in my power to face but which I simply don't want to in order to avoid making it real.

## Writing?
