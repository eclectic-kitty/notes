# Week 12

## Metagaming

Many different meanings!
- culture: self-referentiality
- competitive games: a popular strategy
- meta-gaming, rpg: a player uses knowledge outside of the game when making decisions for the character
- **meta-gaming**, Boluk and Lemieux: Circumstances or contexts outside of a game that inform gameplay

mutually constitutive: can't have one without the other
You can't have the game itself without all the context, history, etc. around it

videogames differ from traditional because of the relation between rules and mechanics
videogames are much more restrictive and controlling
they give players less agency to reshape the rules

Main argument of book:
Studying meta-gaming allows to identify ways of resistance in the present.

cultural materialism: emphasizes economic
meta-gaming: a myriad of factors (including community)

## Utopia
Literally means no place
Describes a perfect place for its citizens
Utopia as an idea is more powerful than a concrete thing
Can be an index of the possible
Utopia as a "what if" resists prescriptive and ...

Reading uses this what if, index idea to
book investigates potential of different kinds of performance to inspire moments in which audiences feel themselves allied with each other, with a broader, more capacious sense of a public, in which social discourse articulates the possible

Small but profound moment in which performance calls the attention of the audience in a way that lifts everyone slightly above the present, into a hopeful feeling of what the world might be like

The audience was singing along a bunch near the end of the show

liminality, outside of time
not limited to big spectacle, can happen in smaller moments
can be compared to flow state, although that is individual

This could be applied to videogames, not just performances

Even if it doesn't directly change the political reality outside of it,
Original theory doesn't include for disconnects in time and space, but in our current digital age we could perhaps expand the concept somewhat
