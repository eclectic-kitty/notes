# Week 6ʔʔʔ - Age of Dissidence

## Intro
One of the only places in the world that is both a destination for migrants, and a place where migrants leave from

### La Bestia

Very dangerous, as people can fall asleep, it's illegal, etc.
400 000 migrants
from Central America for the most part

Empezo a preparar y dar comida a los imigrantes
Ahora es una organizacion que se dedica a peparar y regalar supplies para los migrantes

## Recap (surrealism)
### Panic Movement
A response to surrealism becoming more mainstream
Sought to bring a violence, a chaos to combat this normalisation
Jodorowsky was involved

Sacramental Melodrama
Happening

This kind of performance got him blacklisted!
Transitioned to making comics: The Panic Fables

Political repression in Mexico of a student movement
Capitalism, Technology, etc.
PRI had been in power since the revolution, had gone astray from people's desires
Soocial revendication of democracy, 
Connection to counterculture movement of the '60s
Connection to rupture generation, countering the muralist and post-revolutionary culture

First female athlete lit the flame..
Entering of Mexico into an international community
International hesitance
(athletes had to acclimate to the altitude)

### Perfect Dictatorship
quote from cuban writer
PRI, established in 1929, held power from then until 2000. 71 uninterrupted years
(also 2012 to 2019)
From '64 to '70, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz was president
Had a very authoritarian manner
PRI became more and more authoritarian in the late '60s and into the '70s
backed by the US (ofc)

That Mexico 68 logo is gorgeous tho to be fair
Inspired by geometric patterns and colours of the Huichol

Not involved or included much at all

Also, op art, kinetic art
Lots of gemoetric lines that in movement/concert create more complex images
abstraction, bauhaus, etc.
Lots of colourful circles on the ground...

Alexander Calder


#### Mathias Goeritz (1915-1990): Emotional Architecture

Path of various sculptures from around world
Along 10 miles, along Olympic venues
open-air gallery!

### Tlatelolco Massacre
Ten days before the Olympics
Tlatelolco, Plaza de las tres culturas
(Prehispanic ruins, hispanic church, modernist buildings)
Composed of students from two universities
Used the Olympics to pressure the government
Diaz, in response, directed the army to attack the students on October 12th
Hundreds of students disappeared
No official specific number
300 deaths, 1000+ arrested
Media reported that the students provoked the violence
International media ignored the event

Beginning of the Dirty War
History is being written in recent past
A lot of archival materials only released in last 20 years

Lots of revolutionary art surged in response
People's graphic workshop
Focus on public art
Trying to force media attention
Existed before but strengthened
ALso saught to educate public in art literacy
Individual artists, authorship, not very important to them
Furthermore, anonymity helped with security

#### Detournement:
Method of artistic creation that turns expressions of the capitalist system and its media culture agaist itself - as when slogans and logos are turned against their advertisers of the political status quo

International Situationists
Revolution has to be in the everyday life
situation, lived experience, provocations
Guy Debord, Society of the Spectacle
Passivism, consumption
Critique of capitalism
Social relations through objects, consumption

Ex. Olympic dove being stabbed with a bayonet
From sports pictograms to war pictograms
woodcuts, photocopies
Less of a focus on grand narratives
Transforming simple symbols

Francisco Toledo
Created many cultural institutions in Oaxaca
Institute of graphic arts of Oaxaca

Exposicion Solar Vs Salon Independiente
latter criticized the former
division into categories, traditional
First two editions were not explicitly political
Changed with the third iteration
Group work...
