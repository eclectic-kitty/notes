# Week 1 - Readings - Turing & Lovelace

## The Imitation Game

Huh! I had never heard the part where the machine is *trying* to trick the interrogator, although it kind of makes sense
I wonder what this adversarial relationship does to how we think of the Turing Test

## Defining a digital computer

It's interesting that the computer is already built to imitate a human in some sense

Also randomness = free will is an interesting idea... Not sure what I think about it but it's interesting for sure

Huh, Turing seems quite off on the idea that computers are predictable. Modern AI seems to have somewhat gotten away from us in that sense

Woah! Emulation! Built into the idea of a universal computer


## 6. Contrary views to the main q
It's interesting to me how Turing tries to simplify the idea of thinking? This came up recently with the Google ethicist who thought their chatbot was alive. I'm not sure where I stand... does it matter what "thinking" is? Turing's conceptualisation seems a tad cold though

Oof, the transmigration of souls offhand phrase gives me chills when I think back to SOMA. We really aren't prepared for being in situations outside of our control...

Comparing our fallibility is interesting... What is the value or disvalue of fallibility?

Again with the consciousness argument, how do we prove metacognition? is the appearance of thinking notably different than thinking itself?

Not sure I understand Turing's response fully to the disabilities argument. He seems to just tackle some individual things? Although some things apply more broadly like the capability to make mistakes or not as well as metacognition

The question of whether a machine can be original is certainly something I've thought a lot about with regards to AI art and copyright
