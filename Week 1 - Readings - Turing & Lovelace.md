# Week 1 - Readings - Turing & Lovelace

## Turing

### The Imitation Game

Huh! I had never heard the part where the machine is *trying* to trick the interrogator, although it kind of makes sense
I wonder what this adversarial relationship does to how we think of the Turing Test

### Defining a digital computer

It's interesting that the computer is already built to imitate a human in some sense

Also randomness = free will is an interesting idea... Not sure what I think about it but it's interesting for sure

Huh, Turing seems quite off on the idea that computers are predictable. Modern AI seems to have somewhat gotten away from us in that sense

Woah! Emulation! Built into the idea of a universal computer


### 6. Contrary views to the main q
It's interesting to me how Turing tries to simplify the idea of thinking? This came up recently with the Google ethicist who thought their chatbot was alive. I'm not sure where I stand... does it matter what "thinking" is? Turing's conceptualisation seems a tad cold though

Oof, the transmigration of souls offhand phrase gives me chills when I think back to SOMA. We really aren't prepared for being in situations outside of our control...

Comparing our fallibility is interesting... What is the value or disvalue of fallibility?

Again with the consciousness argument, how do we prove metacognition? is the appearance of thinking notably different than thinking itself?

Not sure I understand Turing's response fully to the disabilities argument. He seems to just tackle some individual things? Although some things apply more broadly like the capability to make mistakes or not as well as metacognition

The question of whether a machine can be original is certainly something I've thought a lot about with regards to AI art and copyright

## Women, Gender and Computing: The Social Shaping of a Technical Field from Ada Lovelace's algorithm to Anita Borg's 'Systers' - Corinna Schlombs

Lovelace celebrated as first programmer

Field in modern times has few women though
20%
stereotype of programmer = man who eats and sleeps badly or genius man

chapter focuses on cultural & social factors *not* individual choice or personal aptitude

Various scholarly writings
- niches for women in computing: Eniac, Colossus, software service companies, listserv
- software crisis in 60's -> professionalization of programming + software *engineering*
- discriminated against in post-WWII Britain

Structure
- comparative review, cross-cultural differences in participation
- Lovelace, structuring forces in social processes
- experiences in modern day, how assumptions about gender and tech shaped e/o
- what was women's role in tech?

### Women in programming across countries

Differences across countries prove nothing inherent about gender and programming
US & Europe - Southeast Asian and Arab countries

Most other scientific fields have started with less women, then rose over 20th century
Computer science started with a lot of women, rose until 1980's (1/3). dropped from then to 2000's (1/5) - Only in US
European countries, similar amount at end of day, diff trajectory
 - Higher in southern and eastern countries, up to 40%
In southeast Asia and Arab countries, from 40 to 70 %, fits with gender roles there (example: Malaysia: safe indoor work, pays well, job security)

Disparity leads to
- economic inequality
- inequality in design
	- ex. bad period tracking apps, Discriminatory AI/algorithms
	
Thoughts:


### Lovelace- First Programmer?

Initially dismissed as bad at math, mentally ill, opiate addict (jeepers)
Reappraisal from 80's to 10's (programming language named after her, books)

"1st programmer", but, digital computer still a century away
Lovelace lived before our ideas around gender, science, and humanities emerged
Ultimately became an assistant

oh! daughter of Lord Byron
Raised entirely by mother (women's rights not great at this point, couldn't even own property)
Still, privileged, well-off
Home-schooled (women not allowed in schools)

studied many subjects: sciences, languages, music, embroidery, etc.
At the time, these subjects were seen as more related, *similar* to today's notion of "interdisciplinary"
Divide didn't emerge til mid-20th century

Became friends with Charles Babbage, who developed ideas for a mechanical calculating machine and a computer (first one not built during lifetime, second never built), had difficulty with funding
Helped him raise awareness and opinion of them by translating French article describing analytical machine
Added notes, including describing how to use it to calculate Bernoulli numbers (program)
Relied on Babbage and London U professor to help her understand math and make sure machine was represented correctly
Lovelace understood better capabilities of machine than Babbage himself

Ultimately though, this is the extent of her contributions -> not a scientific career
Term "scientist" in dev. throughout 19th century
This kind of pursuit was not a "job" for people involved, they were independently wealthy
Also, took on a more assistive, supportive role

### Telegraph, Telephone and Radio; Their Operators; Gendering
