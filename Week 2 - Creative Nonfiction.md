# Week 2 - Creative Nonfiction


## Important aspects of creative nonfiction
- A narrative or poetic format
- Pulling from real(ish) events
	- Often autopbiographical
	- Confessional
	- Actual fact is subservient to emotional truth

### Emily Dickinson poem
Whittling down the truth
Not blinding someone
Bringing out themes, the millionth way we want to tell our story

### A Story about a story
Mythmaking
The more we tell a story, the more it gets away from us
Sensory details can help the best

### Two truths and a lie exercise
The yawning darkness gave way as Adrian and Mateo shined their flashlights into the room. An office door with a window frosted in grime loomed over spongy casks on the far side of the wall
" Wait here! There's some old tower computers in there I think you'll love."
As he hurried into the office, Mateo inspected the casks. A faint smell of whiskey emanating from them as shuffling noises came from the office
" Don't get too close, who knows what mould's growing in there." Said Adrian from behind him.
Mateo could still see his shape through the office window in front of him

## Joan Didion reading
I was struck by the line "children afflicted apparently at birth with some presentiment of loss"
The idea that notebooking, trying to remember these emotions, these selves, is a way of filling a perhaps nonexistent or future hole
Diaries and journals have a different register
Bored with the world, writing it down in order to change it, giving it shape, sharpening it down to a point
Observing people and making up stories about them
We grieve over so much
Fermentation, returning, cycling around, giving it time to create life
Finding the details that can stand in for the feeling

## Notebook tips
Write in colours, add photos, drawings
Write in the margins, direct yourself, associate
Write on different kinds of paper, how does that shape it?

## Alphabetical diaries
Working within a structure, a system, making shape of it yet again!
