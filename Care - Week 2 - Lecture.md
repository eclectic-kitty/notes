## Reading - promiscuous care

Care is our individual and common ability to provide the political, social, material and emotional conditions that allow the vast majority and living creatures on this planet to thrive --- along with the planet itself

**promiscuous care**
Not a concept, theory
an ethic

relied on *Market* and Family for far too long
Something the structures around us need to emphasize, build
Includes:
- more materially sustainable ...
- extend care beyond The Family
- caring for land, water, creatures
- caring beyond just what is lovable, what is easy to love: grotesque
- / jailing of murderers, abusers, etc.

### Optional reading: solidarity art economy

- two artists
- Started as layers of *labor* of love
- Started as diptych
- Paired by cruators? 
- Started as sharing *digital* layers of their own work
- Didin't know if work would be presented digitally or in person
- How to engage someone for longer thn a few seconds
- Were able to *pay* other artists to scan or provide artwork, layers

#### love & care?
- For care there must be a recipient
- love can be selfish, for one's self
- Can love one from afar?

#### resources?
- drink water!
- eat veggies!
  - don't immediately feel good, sure
  - long term great!!!

#### where else should we inject care?
- people around us
- just smiling at someone
- friend has practice:
  - finding one thing of someone else's to compliment

#### How to show care in collaboration
- Taking time to getting to know one another
  - sharing memes
  - regular meetings
- how to support one another inside and outside of art process
  - knowing one another's strengths, skills
  - propping each other up

Making art for the sake of making art, not just capitalist or academic goals
Art ritual

- Scribble every morning for five minutes
- fill the space
- for **yourself**

  - easy-to-read text

#### Resources?
- Fine arts reading room!
  - Studying

#### Injecting care
- Very impunctual
- Figuring this out can show care!
  - taking time to calculate how to get there,
  - how long do get ready
- How do others feel about one being late?
- can also be nice to allow one to be late
  - refreshing!

Caring is more about practice than final object, result

## Nicole Burisch
Curator, FOFA

#### curation & care?
- worked in museum
- taking care of objects
- patrimony
- heal, fix, protect objects
- hypocrisy in colonial museums
- Making cultural objects accessible, keeping them **alive**
- administrative role now
  - contracts!
  - better artist compensation!
  - how to act as advocate in such situations
  - quieter, less sexy, slow, important
  Living takes administration
- bla bla bla

#### process of taking submissions
- launch call 
- juried by FOFA, VAV(?)
- thematic call, new
- open until February 17th

#### resources
- little bit of meditation
  - even a little bit per day
  - just sitting and listening
  - slowing down
  - work comes from slowness,
  - **carefulness**

#### injecting care
- knowing one belongs to a wider community
- widening to a broader set of people
- interacting with others, *showing* care
- taking time

#### No such thing as an art emergency!!!
Mantra thrown around
Does the process feel good? 
Are they taking care of each other, etc.
Creating with intention, doesn't have to be productive, just meditating, taking time, slowing down
**final product is not important!!!** 

## interjection from Molly(? the teacher)

#### Social media self care
- very liberal
- focused on *self*
- how do we create collective systems of care?
allow others to care for us?

#### failure and care
- where do they intersect?
- failing to care
- caring for our failures
- failures as care
- Khadija:
  - **how do we care to fail?**
  - allow ourselves to fail, to not be perfect
  - writing to-do lists, so they're there, knowing they'll never be completed
