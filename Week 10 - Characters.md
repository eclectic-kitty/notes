# Week 10 - Characters

## Reading: Sonny's Blues

### Thots!
How are the various elements of fiction used throughout the story?

A heavy focus on characters, the conflict between two characters, their internal conflicts, and their worldviews

This conflict is not immediately apparent, as it has many layers, which are slowly peeled away over the course of the story. 

I was struck by how well I came to understand this conflict, and how I went thorugh many cycles of feeling like I understood where it was going, and then going deeper

I was struck by how the descriptions turned more and more poetic as it went on, as the layer turned more philosophical, and more personal at the same time

I like how Sonny is struggling to express himself, he knows the shape of his pain but he can't quite see it all at the same time, he can't get it out. 


### Exposition

All happens through the "I"
Given through flashbacks
Gives us a sense of certainty, understanding is already there even if we don't truly know
Despite this, we are truly missing so much context
Very removed as well, at first, newspaper, letter, friend

### Perspective

Very restricted perspective from the narrator
We don't even learn his name!
Yet, he feels very confident with regards to himself and his worldview, that he is *good*
It's very misplaced however, and constantly challenged
He always frames these conflicts as external, invasions
Contrast with Sonny and his internal conflict, his feeling out of place in the world, his trying to express his pain
The way the story is structured, emphasises Sonny's struggles
We barely hear from him until the end of the story, where he finally is able to let it all go
We begin to hear from him through a newspaper, then a friend, then a letter, then a memory, then a conversation, and finally music

ALl while Sonny struggles to express himself, to let people in, and to get others to hear him

### Sonny and narrator
Narrator sees him as a child, perpetually his younger brother
He feels he needs to protect him
Sees him as fragile, trying to be careful
There is indeed a fragility there as an addict

Hearing a kid whistling, first moment where he sees a child, as his own person, holding its own amongst all the other sounds

## Dialogue

How does it sound when you speak it out loud?
Does it sound natural or unnatural?

How do we communicate with others? with ourselves?
How does it describe a setting?
actions, feelings, abstract ideas, internal/external

### 3 main parts
- direct
	- dialogue!
- indirect
	- gives the feeling of speech, without it actually happening. no quotation marks.
	- ex: Had Jo bought the supplies? She had been waiting all day and they couldn't move forward with the plan without it.
- summarizing
	- single line, takes care of it, condenses and moves story along
	- ex: Mary and Jo talked at length about the plan

### approach
What is the character's diction, slang, syntax, 
cadence, pacing
how are emotions expressed?

Experiments!
Are they really verbose?
Do they constantly interrupt themselves?
Do they use many shorter words? or million dollar words?
What's their background?
How do they see the world?
How do they see themselves?

How do they address others?

How would they react to specific events?
An elephant falling from the sky?
traffic?

Observe! Eavesdrop!

### Formatting
At some point you can let it just flow, with indent, back and forth

What happens if you don't indent?
If you don't use quotation marks?

### Writing about other experiences
Find similar emotions?
Mother, protection, how do you feel about protection?

Research!

Consider the ethics
Respect subject position
When is it ok or not?
