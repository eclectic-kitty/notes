# Final - Outline

## Introduction

### Proposal: 
We often take for granted that our bodies are under our control. But for almost all of us, our bodies simply don't behave the way they're "supposed" to. Despite our best efforts, they smell, they secrete, they age. They're not even entirely ours. However, the fiction that we can tame our bodies is reinforced incessantly. We are shamed into buying endless products to try and tame our bodies and behave the way we are expected to. I chose the keyword combination "framing the body" because I want to explore artworks that present radical reframings of what bodies can be to shock and entrance the audience into reworking their own internal framings of bodies.

### Edits?
Currently bringing it in through control
The lies we tell ourselves about the control over our own bodies
Maybe bring in others?
Influences?

### New thesis:
The works I have chosen all reframe bodies as abject, breaking down and decomposing the audience's conceptions of their bodies, the bodies of others, and where the barriers between these lie. 

## Anatomy
### Thesis
Consider your connections more, treat others with respect, don't think you're the main character 

### Role of body
The abject body of something close to us but inhuman, breaks barriers of what can be human, then has us empathize with the pain and fear of the house

## Annihilation
### Thesis
Change is scary, but necessary to avoid tragedy, to maintain connections, to grow, relationships change you

### Frame
Body as a site of change

#### Questions
- Who are we?
- Do we have control over our bodies?
- What influence do others have on us?

### What role does the body play?
The film presents bodies undergoing abject changes, initially in horrifying, tragic and beautiful manners

To a certain extent, more internal, about your relationships with others and your own pain, change, etc.

## Human Botany
### Thesis
View your own body & sexual pleasure with the same respect and awe you would give a beautiful flower and the processes by which they reproduce

## Conclusion


## Exhibit framing
