# Final - Outline

## Introduction

### Proposal: 
We often take for granted that our bodies are under our control. But for almost all of us, our bodies simply don't behave the way they're "supposed" to. Despite our best efforts, they smell, they secrete, they age. They're not even entirely ours. However, the fiction that we can tame our bodies is reinforced incessantly. We are shamed into buying endless products to try and tame our bodies and behave the way we are expected to. I chose the keyword combination "framing the body" because I want to explore artworks that present radical reframings of what bodies can be to shock and entrance the audience into reworking their own internal framings of bodies.

### Edits?
Currently bringing it in through control
The lies we tell ourselves about the control over our own bodies
Maybe bring in others?
Influences?

### New thesis:
The works I have chosen all reframe bodies as abject, breaking down and decomposing the audience's conceptions of their bodies, the bodies of others, and where the barriers between these lie. 

## Anatomy
### Thesis
Consider your connections more, treat others with respect, don't think you're the main character 

### Frame: place
- What do we consider to be embodied?
- What do we care for?

Do we consider the systems we are a part of and what impact we have?
How much do we consider and care for the places we exist in and the objects around us? 
How does all this impact us?

Illuminates issues of control, consideration, and utility of bodies

### Abject 
Barrier: **self / environment**
- What "other"s do we rely on?

### Body genre
The body in ecstasy and undergoing changes, which we are usually meant to empathize with, is in this case the house

### Thots
The abject body of something close to us but inhuman, breaks barriers of what can be human, then has us empathize with the pain and fear of the house

## Connections
Capacity to accept change
Consideration of impact on others
Greater focus on external connections

## Annihilation
### Thesis
Change is scary, but necessary to avoid tragedy, to maintain connections, to grow, relationships change you

### Frame: change
- What is our 'self'?
- How much influence do others have?

Are we really as static as we believe?
Why do we idolize a perfect nonexistant state of youth?
How much control can we truly exercise on our own bodies?
Can it 

### Abject
Barrier: **self / others**

I don't know how to phrase it

### Thots
The film presents bodies undergoing abject changes, initially in horrifying and tragic fashion

Annihilation grapples with the attraction to what is abject, with Freud's death-drive, self-destruction

Ultimately, we must stop trying to control change, annihilation is inevitable, but something new always comes from it

## Connections
Learning to love ourselves and "imperfections"
Valuing connections and understanding impact on others
Viewing bodies as objects

## Human Botany
### Thesis
View your own body & sexual pleasure with the same respect, beauty, and level-headedness you would a flower, a specimen.

### Frame: science
- What standards do we hold ourselves to?
- What associations do certain features or actions have?

Are our bodies not living beings like any other? Beautiful, yes, but not any more important or as important to control.

### Abject
self / object
- The breakdown here allows audience to see themselves through the lens of an object
- Legitimizes and allows for a certain neutrality

## Conclusion
