# Week 9 - Queer Art

## Zapatistas
1994, new year's eve
TOok over San Cristobal de las Casas
Indigenous, want autonomy and indigenous control of their land and resources
Successful, still around and in control (not sure about using this language here) of land in Chiapas

## Neo-Mexicanism

reaffirmation of figurative painting
Emphasis on self representation
emerged as an individual movement
categorization applied after the fact by historians
period of national self-questioning
university-trained, born in the '50s
Recovery of symbols of national identity, 
Fragmentation (of picture plane and body?)
Better appreciated outside of Mexico

### Julio Galán, Charro (2001)
self-portrait
charro clothes, ranchero, horseman, akin to a cowboy
mariachis dress like charros
national symbols
confronting machismo, heteronormativity and homophobia

### Context:
'80s, the lost decade
La guerra sucia
loss of trust in the government
economic crisis
Miguel de la Madrid, considered 1st neoliberal president
Earthquake of '85, Mexico City
between 3 and 4 billion USD in damages
Mexican gov. took far too long to react to crisis
ex. Rubén Ortiz Torres: End of Modernism
Almost futurist it feels?
But opposite in meaning
'86 FIFA World Cup
End of utopian modernist project

### Los catastrofistas, vale-madristas
other early names given to these artists
canvas a space for nostalgia, past and present
*hauntology!!!
wanting

Dulce María Núǹes, Smoky Dreams
indigenous art, Zapatistas

Monica Castillo, National Soup, 1987 !
Alejandro Arango, La Batalla
Georgina Quintana, Mirror with Sewing Machine, 1987 !
Fragmentation of
body, nation, plane, flag, etc.

Javier de la Garza, Cuauhtémoc !
Other painting
Mix of prehispanic and colonoial symbols

Alejandro Colunga, Cristo sin Madero !!!
Ortiz Torres, The Persistence of Memory, 1987 !!!
Sacrifice of history, of the people at this time
Disenchantment, existential
No projection of what comes after

Ismael Vargas, In Tepoztlan, 1989 !!!
more folkloric images

Nahúm B. Zenil, Ex-Voto, 1987 !!!
ex-voto:
wax body part
offering to divinity
As king for a miracle, or gratitude for a miracle,
bringing object, or part representation of thing, of miracle
popular folk art, displayed in churches
include narrative of what happened, divinity, text
Frida Kahlo collected them!

Rise of international interest in Latin American art
Frida Kahlo!
Market shifted drastically
A Kahlo painting went for 20,000 to 1 mill.+
Muralism, ruptura as well
Not los grupos, for ex.

### Critique, money
Criticism early on about commercialisation of this movement
Crit. of the movement itself inviting this, being for an international audience
An art made for export
It began to produce what the market asked for
Obvious Mexican symbols, esp. in contrast with someone like Maria Izquierdo

### 90's
Sudden upspring of social movements (Zapatistas)
Further entrenchment of neo-liberalism
Contested election in '88
privatization of many state-owned services (oil, mining, water, etc.)
NAFTA (same day as the Zapatistas!)
Further loss of credibility of the PRI
PRI candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, assasinated

Zenil, Bendiciones, 1990 !!!

### Julio Galán
Andy Warhol discovered him and propelled him to success
Up until then was very closeted
almost porcelain like appearance
Doubles, nudity
Died at 46 in 2006
traumatic for the artistic community

### Nahum B. Zenil
Very modest background
art teacher before becoming a recognixed painter
Never quite as recognized as someone like Galan
Again, a lot of self-portraiture
A lot of reverence for Kahlo at a time that she was far less appreciated
Violence, a lot of hearts
sexual identity, closeeted
More doubles
A lot of catholic imagery

## Closing thoughts: Fabian Chairez, La Revolución, 2014
100 years celebration of Zapata, 2020, Bellas Artes
A lot of controversy in Mexico
